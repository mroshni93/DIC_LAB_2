When she is not administering regular therapy, she is often advising middle and high school students whose inability to organize their schoolwork, she says, is hurting their grades, and their self-esteem. Dr. Kornblum helps them develop sorting strategies, workable planners and study schedules while also challenging some of the negative thoughts swimming around in their heads.A lot of my clients will say I did my homework I forgot to hand it in a number of times My grades are suffering And now I feel badly about myself she said What we do is get at the core of whyThere is no official count of how many New York City tutors do this hybrid work But tutoring centers say demand is on the riseThe Brooklyn Learning Center launched its Homework Therapy program in with one therapisttutor in its Brooklyn Heights office It has since opened centers in Park Slope and TriBeCa and enlists homework therapists of them full timeImageAmy Margolis second from right led a meeting at the Brooklyn Learning Center which now has fulltime homework therapistsCreditSarah Blesener for The New York TimesAnna LevyWarren a New Yorkbased psychotherapist who opened her oneperson practice in now has more than tutors with mental healthrelated degrees who fan out across the city on weeknights and weekends They also conduct sessions via SkypeAnd 10 years ago, Inspirica, a high-priced, New York City-based tutoring company that specializes in one-on-one test preparation, had no tutors with social work or psychology-related degrees. The founder and chief executive, Lisa Jacobson, says there are now eight in her New York office.Now its all about calming people down Ms Jacobson saidThe focus on students emotional health is part of a larger movement in education Today most educators are trained in socialemotional development and advancements in brain imaging are increasingly indicating how closely cognition and emotions are linkedWork by the Stanford University psychology professor Carol Dweck on growth mindset the importance of believing that you can learn and change and the University of Pennsylvanias Angela Duckworth on grit or the ability to overcome setbacks have convinced parents and educators that they can increase childrens motivation and goal setting with the right techniquesFurther school administrators say there has been a notable uptick in the number of students who arrive each year with neuropsychological evaluations a costly but extensive set of tests often used to determine why a student is struggling to perform The results include information about learning disabilities like attention deficit disorder and dyslexia but also a students emotional stateEllen B. Braaten, the associate director of The Clay Center for Young and Healthy Minds in Boston, says the arrival of this new breed of clinician/coaches is not unique to New York, but is also finding a footing in areas around Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Northern California, where pressure on students to succeed is high and therapy isnt stigmatized.The homework therapists can put up with a lot of dramaLeah Kesselman, a 28-year-old psychologist who works with Beyond BookSmart, a Boston-based firm with dozens of coaches in the New York area, says she has dealt with students who have repeatedly yelled at her, Get Out, or We dont need you. To calm them down, she sometimes suggests a few minutes of video gaming or the Spotify playlists.Dr LevyWarren the New York psychotherapist says she worked with a student who once sobbed to her after learning she had received a B on a paper To help she used reframing a popular cognitive behavioral therapy technique getting at what a B symbolized to her and helping her develop a more positive outlookMellora Ansbro a recent graduate of Johns Hopkins University began working with Dr LevyWarren when she was a junior at Riverdale Country School a private school in the Bronx During meetings that sometimes began at pm Dr LevyWarren taught her how to write an essay and take better notes and also how to navigate the high school social scene and manage her parents Six years later shortly after graduating from college and anxious about her life Ms Ansbro now hired Dr LevyWarren againI was freaking out she said It was a big transition And I felt underpreparedOver the last year and a half Dr LevyWarren has helped her come up with a study plan for the GRE apply to graduate school and ward off worries about what she should and should not be doing with her life She has also boosted Ms Ansbros spirits when occasional bouts of worry and depression have set inBut Dr Braaten at The Clay Center notes that there are no licensing requirements for homework therapists so guidelines as to what services they actually provide can be murky and uniform standards are nonexistent Some build glitter globes with their students to serve as relaxing tools Others use aromatherapy oils and encourage students to create flash cards with affirming motivational mantras like I got this or Done is Better than PerfectFurther Dr Braaten says there is no strong evidence that this type of hybrid treatment worksHolly Schiffrin a professor of psychological science at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg Va who researches adolescent development and depression says she thinks a tutor who helps a struggling student with study skills and confidence makes senseBut there should be a plan in place for them to become fully functioning independent adults she saidA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Guiding Hand For Algebra And Anxiety.

      "b'AdvertisementOpinionSupported byTrade and the Cities WonkishBy Paul KrugmanMarch Bad policies sometimes lead to interesting economics For example the disastrous turn toward austerity after was a kind of natural experiment that led to an upwelling of good work on the effects of fiscal policyAnd Im starting to think that the Trumpian trade war which finally seems to have arrived will lead to some good work on international economic policy Like the work on fiscal policy it will of course be ignored by people in power But still worth doingIn this little essay Im going to offer some analysis and a few numbers based on a chain of thought that begins with Trumps evident disdain for Japan and ends up in Atlanta New Orleans and Buffalo What Bear with me if you have a taste for things wonkishMy starting point is a peculiar aspect of Trumps climbdown on steel tariffs The ostensible justification for these tariffs was national security but as was widely noted from the start although this probably came as news to the Trumpies most US steel imports come from American allies And now Trump has granted exemptions to allies that largely vitiate the supposed point of the exerciseOne country that has conspicuously not been granted an exemption, however, is Japan. Why not?One answer may be that the Japanese arent you know whiteAnother answer may be that Trump, who often seems to have fixed ideas about the world that are long out of date  like his belief that American cities are gripped by a huge crime wave  is still living in the Michael Crichton era when Japan was going to take over the world any day now.Yet a third answer may be that the US does run a trade deficit with Japan actually even bigger than the headline number if you include Japanese components embedded in Chinese exports and Trump believes that a a trade deficit means that youre losing while someone else is winning and b trade balances are determined by protectionismBoth propositions are of course untrue In reality trade balances are the flip side of capital flows countries that attract more inflows of foreign capital than their own outflows must by the sheer arithmetic run current account deficits that is including investment income Conversely countries that are exporters of capital run current account surplusesAnd modern Japan is a country that really should be running current account surpluses for one powerful reason demography Japan has a rapidly declining working age populationImageThis means limited opportunities for investment which means that its a country that should be investing its savings abroadBut the claim that trade surpluses often reflect weakness while trade deficits reflect strength is a very hard sell And demographic drivers of trade imbalances are usually a lot less clear than thisThis however got me thinking what about regions within the United States We have sharply different growth rates across metropolitan areas mainly driven by in or outmigration There are no protectionist barriers to muddy the picture and capital is surely highly mobile within the countryUnfortunately, we dont have comprehensive regional balance of payments data. Thanks to researchers at Brookings, however, we do now have a lot of information on the exports and imports of metropolitan areas  exports and imports to and from other parts of the U.S. as well as the rest of the world. Im not sure how safe it is to use these data to estimate trade balances, but let me take a stab at it.These data only cover goods they dont cover either services or income transfers like say Social Security receipts which as well see in a second can make a big difference So I dont think I can run any regressions here But I still think looking at metropolitan trade balances can be enlighteningSo lets look at the metros with the biggest goods trade deficits and surplusesFirst the biggest deficits data for in billions of dollarsWashington billionMiami billionSan Francisco billionAtlanta billionBaltimore billionOK Washington runs a huge deficit in goods basically what it exports is garbage No literally waste is the only product in which it runs a surplus But this goods deficit is presumably offset by services both the federal budget and stuff like payments to K Street lobbyists My guess is that Baltimore has some of the same stuffMiami meanwhile is selling warm weather to senior citizens who live largely off Social Security and MedicareThe big deficit surprise here to someone with a Trumpist view of trade balances would surely be Atlanta which has been one of our fastestgrowing metropolitan areas a percent increase in population between and And were talking about a big deficit about percent of metro GDP Whats that aboutThe answer surely is that the deficit is a reflection of Atlantas growth were talking about building lots of housing office parks and so on and much of that is financed by capital inflows from the rest of the countryNext the biggest surplusesLos Angeles billionMemphis billionGreensboro billionCorpus Christi billionNew Orleans billionLos Angeles is a very big metropolitan area but also one whose growth has slowed a lot it has run out of land and zoning restrictions have kept it from building up So its population rose only percent from to As a result it has probably become a big exporter of excess savings hence a city with big trade surpluses around percent of GDP probably even bigger if we had data on servicesI havent done enough homework to know whats going on in the middle three here But did you know that New Orleans runs huge trade surpluses And I mean huge almost percent of GDP in Now I dont think many people would consider New Orleans an economic winner In fact its population declined percent from to partly because of Katrina but also because of wider problems And that very decline means that savings generated in New Orleans go elsewhere in search of returnsYou can see the same thing in smaller cities with declining populations BuffaloNiagara Falls saw a percent population decline in the s in it ran a trade surplus of percent of GDPAnd what about the Big Apple Greater New York ran a small goods trade deficit percent of GDP in but thanks to the financial industry surely ran a huge surplus in services Remember this is the metro area not just New York so there are plenty of goods exports from say the pharma complex in New Jersey So its a big surplus economy overall not because its growing fast but because despite immigration its overall population is growing slowlySo to sum things up within the United States we have large regional trade imbalances that dont reflect unfair trade policies because interstate trade is totally free And running trade surpluses isnt a sign of success nor is running deficits a sign of failure If anything much of the time its the reverse fastgrowing regions run deficits stagnating regions run surplusesThe same principles apply at the international level And Im sure experts in the Trump administration will explain to the president why his view of such things is all wrong Oh wait Follow me on Twitter (PaulKrugman) and Facebook.

      "b'AdvertisementSupported byReader Idea Rhythm Rhyme and Haggis Celebrating the Poetry of Robert BurnsImageFraser MacGregor, owner of the butchery George Cockburn & Son, scoops out haggis from boiling water. Related ArticleCreditRobert Ormerod for The New York TimesBy Alan Gillespie and The Learning NetworkMarch In the spirit of National Poetry Month, this Reader Idea illustrates one teachers delight in words  whether found in a New York Times travel piece on the making of haggis, in the verse of Robert Burns, or in the Modern Scots language his students use themselves.Do you teach with The Times? Tell us about it here, or browse our full collection of Reader Ideas.Or, invite your students to take part in our annual Found Poem Student Contest, which runs from March 28 to May 4 this year.And if youd like 22 more ideas for teaching and learning about poetry, visit this collection.Idea: A teacher in Scotland invites his students to play with poetic language in the style and spirit of Robert Burns, the national poet.Teacher Alan GillespieGrade Level and School 12 to 14-year-olds at the Fernhill School in Glasgow, ScotlandWhy We Chose It With the use of just one Times article, this teacher reworks the customary Robert Burns school assignment (rote-learning poems about mice and lice) and, instead, has his students revel in language new and old, making the famous Burns Stanza their own.What Mr Gillespie Did and Why In His Own WordsImageThe town of Dingwall in the Scottish Highlands where George Cockburn Son is locatedCreditRobert Ormerod for The New York TimesEvery January pupils across Scotland are besieged with lessons and assemblies about Robert Burns, our national poet, in honor of Burns Night.Its a legitimate and important landmark that young people should be aware of and celebrate, but Ive always been a little uncertain about how we, as teachers, go about it. I was never sure what exactly students were meant to be getting out of all these recitals and Tartan Days.Why are they rotelearning poems about mice and lice Are they just celebrating Burns for the sake of celebration itself What skills are they actually learning and developing that they can relate to and build uponWell over years since Burnss death the rich Scots language that he used can be pretty intimidating to decipher A lot of pupils can indeed recite whole chunks from his Greatest Hits To a Mouse Tam o Shanter Auld Lang Syne but I doubt they could tell you what all the words actually mean What is a syne anyway I wanted to try and do something a little more relatable with my class to try and teach them a few things that they might be able to put to use in future lessons or in later lifeTo do this I needed a stimulus, and this fabulous piece of travel writing from 2014 was perfect: In Scotland Guts Glory and Haggis.It focuses on one of Burnss most celebrated topics the mysterious and elusive haggis and gives pupils a modern insight written in an engaging style I used this article as the launch pad and inspiration for these lessonsTo simply read memorize and recite Burnss poems felt pretty onedimensional to me I thought it was far more useful for students to play about with the language that he used and the structure of his poetry but also to write in their own register which could be described as a pretty standard form of English with a smattering of regional colloquialismsWhy write exclusively in the language of Burns when students have their own evolving, intricate modern Scots instead? I wanted to make use of both, and to do this I provided a glossary of fabulously expressive Scots words used today (bauchle blether dreich fankle gallus mooch pockle slitter wabbit wheescht but also spoke to the class about how they spoke and what regional phrases they had in their armory.Below the lesson sequence Notes to students are in italics followed by my own notes on what happened in classImageFraser MacGregor serves a customer at George Cockburn SonCreditRobert Ormerod for The New York TimesLearning Intentions To understand how haggis is made To learn about the Burns Stanza To become familiar with new Scots wordsStarter ActivityWorking with a partner discuss what a haggis is What is it made of How is it made Where does it come from Write down a description that you could give to a tourist Be prepared to share these descriptions with the classIt became clear from this that students didnt have a great awareness of what constituted a haggis to begin with There were lots of answers skirting around the idea of sheep but these were a bit wooly forgive the pun They had loads of vague knowledge about Burns Suppers and turnips but nothing specific Hence the reading task that came nextReading TaskRead the article explaining how a haggis is madeUsing highlighter pens pick out key phrasesYou should look for Descriptive phrases and adjectives Key verbs and actions Key nouns facts and items Writing features such as simile alliteration etcDuring this phase of the lesson it became clear that the language of the article was perfect for engaging the pupils who had in all honesty not been hugely enthused by the idea of a lesson on BurnsThe writer uses fantastically gritty and descriptive language to help the reader visualize smell and feel the preparation of the haggis yanking veins from lungs picking lumps of meaty gruel from her fingernails the glorious stench of the sheeps stomach Its wonderful and made the whole class sit up and take notice as they highlighted their favorite bitsWhile Burns is often lauded for his use of wit and humor, I feel that in schools we often overlook the craft and technical expertise evident in his work. I used the first verse of the immortal Address to a Haggis to illustrate the tight rhythm and rhyme scheme which he popularized  what became known as the Burns Stanza, as closely associated with him as sonnets are with Shakespeare. This was a key piece of information and I did not move on from this until I felt confident that the whole class understood the format.Notetaking TaskThe Burns Stanza Six lines long Follows an AAABAB rhyme scheme Lines are always the same length For exampleFair fa your honest sonsie face A Great chieftain o the puddinrace A Aboon them a ye tak your place A Painch tripe or thairm B Weel are ye worthy o a grace A As langs my airm B Writing TaskIn pairs Write instructions for preparing and cooking haggis according to the New York Times article about the George Cockburn Son butchery This should be in the form of a Burns Stanza poem follow the same rhyme scheme and length You should write at least three stanzas and make use of at least six Scots words use the glossary and include ones of your own You should include key words and phrases from the article and the glossary Tick these off the list as you use themI was really pleased with the response and enthusiasm shown by pupils when writing their poems They had clearly understood the method for making haggis from the article which they referred to frequently and they grappled with the rigidity of the Burns Stanza until they found themselves able to tweak phrasing and expression to fit the lines and create strong rhymesThey used some of the traditional words from the Burns glossary but many also included modern Scots that they knew and used themselves The paired work allowed for plenty of discussion meaning that the lessons incorporated the four key strands of English reading writing talking and listening All that remained was for me to help with rhyming ideas and check their understandingHow did I know that they had learned what I wanted them to They emailed me their poems which were finished as homework Take a lookStudent ExamplesPoem No written by Ava and ErinI laid my hauns on the livers,Cut up into tiny slivers,Giving me horrible shivers,Rubbery veins,Lambs blood flowing like a river,And greetin weans.The Butcher wis awfy swankie,Even though his hauns were manky,Gies ma pudding!

simple threehand watch Thereafter I would research endlessly until I found something that ticks all the boxes The categories that are most important to me are movementnishing wearability aesthetics and the vision of the brandMR MEHTA of the Belgian Watch ClubI love nothing more than the research and hunting period where I try to find every piece of information on any given reference or example known to man I do it through my own records that Ive accumulated after years of world travel for watches with Hodinkee my network of friends auction houses and old books and magazines There are any number of websites out there writing about watches even more Instagram pages and the first thing to know is not all experts are created equalMR CLYMER of HodinkeeVintage watches can be a little perplexing at first People throw around reference numbers that sound like theyre reciting a Fibonacci sequence and they debate minuscule details which sometimes arent even visible to the naked eye Vintage watches are a challenging category in collectibles and thats precisely what attracts so many collectors Start by gathering as much information about the watch youre personally interested in Learn about the manufacturers history find out how many watches they produced in which metals with which dials In other words do your homeworkARTHUR TOUCHOT head of digital and watch specialist Phillips auction house based in GenevaHow do I build a collectionIt is good to follow your passion but we also have to consider the ongoing market For example why should we buy a pocket watch today if these items totally lost value over the timeMS MONDANI of Mondani WebLook for themes that interest you whether it be a particular brand complication or feature Learn as much as you can about that initially then look at brands that might have that as a focus Personally I have a soft spot for titanium watches I like that theyre quite light compared with steel which makes them very comfortable on the wristSEAN LI editorial and business development director Blackbird Watch Manual websiteTheres really no road map to this Whats important is that you pursue what interests you Not trends and what other people around you are buying Do your research talk to others who share your interest take your time and enjoy the processSUMIT NAG online editor for Revolution Media in SingaporeTo build your collection with confidence focus on authenticity quality rarity provenance and pieces with accompanying documentation Stay informed by consulting professionals and always try to improve your network My advice Taking your time means saving timeMS CHICHA of IconeekDepending on your budget of course I think your quest will have different stages over time With patience you will find the exact watch you wish to add to your collectionMR FRIEDMAN of WatchonistaHow do I store my watchesA safe at home for your daily pieces and one at the bank for the rest of your collection You can also loan pieces to museums it will be a good way to transmit your passion to other people For me its important to share to share your passion share your knowledge share your love for watchmaking From my point of view if you leave all your pieces in the back of your safe its a pityMR GARDINETTI of the Fondation de la Haute HorlogerieYou can choose one or several solutions such as having a personal safe home security measures a bank vault or free ports Whatever your choice make sure your watches are protected from water humidity dust and direct exposure to light My advice The best protection is discretionMS CHICHA of IconeekOther important aspectsToo often we hear stories of a watch being stolen from having been left out in the open Even worse is when the watch is not insured Adding watches to a homeowners policy is simple and in most cases not too costly most insurers require just a certified appraisal from the dealer who sold the watch to youLIAM WEE TAY chairman of the online sale site WatchBox in Hong KongYou should insure your collection Ask for documents with insurance values or contact an independent watch expert to create a portfolio of your collection with detailed pictures descriptions and estimates Then proceed with your insurance companyMS CHICHA of IconeekUltimately what I enjoy most about watch collecting is the emotional and intellectual rush I get from learning things that are not widely known and then the great reveal to my other collector friends One of the great joys of collecting is really the people you will meet and though there is always some mild competition among friends the support from this group of people is really something very special and one that is not found in many other areas Watch collecting is also a fun way to hone your critical mind and provides a nice vehicle to support international travel above all else it is a lot of fun The minute it stops being fun you should stopMR CLYMER of HodinkeeI used to keep and keep and keep But maybe at this time of my life I would fancy some changes Lets upgradeMR FRIEDMAN of WatchionistaMost collectors will buy a watch because A they dont have it B they have one but in poorer condition or C its part of a family or set that they are trying to complete And then there are those who buy watches just because they can They collect to keep They arent so concerned with upgrading because they often start with the very best Ultimately though everyone is collecting to upgrade because tastes change over time and new pieces become available Every watch has its price and sometimes that means starting over One of the consignors from the Heuer Parade auction held last year sold most of his collection because he felt he had done it He had spent almost a decade finding Heuer chronographs from a specific era and once he had them he needed a new challenge He is still collecting watches today but from other manufacturersMR TOUCHOT of PhillipsChances are the first to watches you end up buying will also be the first instances of watches that you flip Collecting is a journey of learning after all The more knowledge you amass the more you discover about the world of watches and what you like about your watches In turn your collection evolvesMR NAG of Revolution MediaPersonally I feel what one does with each watch depends on its history and mechanism A vintage watch with different complications hard to find is definitely meant to be kept On the other hand the latest watches in the market are eligible to be changed if you feel there are better ones in the market The simple strategy of selling a watch to fund a better one is acceptableMR AL HAJ of HomebazarWhats the next big thingWe are starting to see a resurgence in popularity of contemporary vintage pieces. By this, I mean watches from the 1980s-1990s. Pieces from this era that stand out to us are IWC Pilots watches, Jaeger-LeCoultre Calendars, previous generation Lange models. Furthermore, ultraexclusive brands like FP Journe will be very desirable moving forward. They have seriously low production numbers and have already begun captivating collectors around the world.MR TAY of WatchBoxSteel sport watches from Rolex continue to be a smart option for parking your money with the added benefit of being able to wear them out on the weekends take the newest Daytona for example the MSRP of this watch is BLAKE BUETTNER director of watches the ecommerce company StockX in DetroitIts impossible to say which model will be the next big thing and its very difficult to look past early Rolex Daytonas these days However its a hard and fast rule that vintage watches that are original and well preserved today will have enduring value We will almost certainly see the value of the most soughtafter watches continue to appreciate as new collectors enter this field of collectiblesMR TOUCHOT of PhillipsI am not sure if there is anything left to be collected it seems to me that every possible item is already being collected by someoneSABINE KEGEL international senior specialist and head of Christies Geneva Watch Department Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and Instagram.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page S6 in The International New York Times.

from the popular game Fortnite Battle RoyaleCreditEpic GamesOur most popular writing prompt this week asked students Are You a Fortnite Addict Sloth Jesus from Wilmington NC,  with the most recommended comment  paints this vivid picture of what its like to play Fortnite:For a lot of people Fortnite is just a game you can play with your friends when you are caught up with your homework after school to have fun and relax right For others it is a completely different experience It becomes a bit of a life or death situation as extreme as it sounds You have to trust your squad mates with your life or else youre as good as deadIts kind of an awesome feeling you and your friends all together against multiple other groups of friends You battle it out in building and gun play to defeat your opponents Overall it is a very fun game that builds enjoyment and experience in stressful situations that help you build better relationships with your friendsWhen I play with my friends we are all in a party or a chatroom constantly talking about whatever comes to our minds Its nothing too serious until someone hears a gunshot at our squadDid you guys hear about what happened in rd block todayGunshotShots NW someone says The entire conversation changes From conversation to callouts in an absolute instant Your team gets ready to face the coming threatThe addiction itself comes from winning in my belief From dropping Salty Springs to running and gunning around the map with a deadly storm pitting the final survivors against one another to the final battle atop a great mountain to seeing the words Victory Royale on your screen Its a rush of satisfaction and joy because you wonDaniel Lee from California gives some reasons for why its so popular:An immense topic of discussion is the creeping shadow of Fortnite an online multiplayer shooting game When I first heard of it I diminished it as a minor and simple video game that might gain some popularity and die off in the duration of a few months However the number one thing that my friends talk about arent the plot twists of Infinity War nor the difficulty of the math test on Tuesday but whether or not they should buy a skin for their character in Fortnite to look decent enough when theyre firing at another playerVideo games alone are addicting but a game such as Fornite has the potential to become a sort of black hole an endless void that squeezes the reason and sense out of students like myself The most appealing aspect of Fortnite is the gameplay of a mode called Battle Royale Well over characters are set down in a continuously shrinking arena where they can accumulate weapons and tools build complex structures and prepare for the battle that will determine to the be the winner A laughable model of The Hunger Games I didnt and still to this day never did understand why my friends would want to play the game which to me was as addictive and attractive as watching paint dry on a wall However to my friends Fortnite sees like an island in a sea of mediocre video games a spark of imagination in a dark timeJessica from Fla says Fornite has consumed her school, but she doesnt think the game is toxic:I can say from experience that Fortnite is in fact a very addicting and enjoyable game I recently downloaded because of all the hype and play it on a regular basis with my friend I wouldnt say that I personally am addicted to the game however I do find myself playing it in my free time To be quite honest Im not even sure why exactly the game is so popular The graphics are really pretty and the concept is nice but its just one of hundreds of shooting video games that exist I do think that at my school Fortnite has become something that consumes a lot of time from nearly all the students Its constantly being talked about and played by students including myself during class time throughout the day Ive even noticed that people will post all of their wins or the victory royale screen on their social media such as on snapchat Sometimes people will post as much as or pictures of the gaming screen everytime they win which can end up being really annoying in my opinion Although this game is so popular and may consume the time of a lot of individuals I do not believe that it has any truly toxic effects on those who play it I honestly think its just another really hyped up video game that will eventually die down over timeAbe Barerra from Oregon and his parents came up with rules to to curb his Fornite addiction:Hello Im a year old kid here After reading this article and scrutinizing the comment section I have come to the conclusion that people generally have two sides in this lively debateWhile some people state that Violent Games Fortnite or other Games in General tend to lead to violent aggression there is other people who believe that games lead to social and life skills I can agree with both sides of the conversation For example I play video games as well with a few wins on fortnite myself I can agree that the game itself is very addicting This game creates a gambling affect that makes it hard for people to stop I know that when I am told to stop by my parents I feel anger and thats just not normal The problem with this is that this anger is just temporary I wont feel any more later but like trying to stop a gambler from playing poker its really hard to get someone to just stop playing video games There is also the benefits of video games from being able to cooperate with each other in a similar social settings to enhance memory improve coordination and improves problem solving skills The solution that my parents and I cooperated We put up a set of rules for the weekday I cannot play video games without first studying doing homework chores and even then the most I can play is around hour min In the weekend the rules are similar but with a few changes I cannot play without studying and chores I can play but I also need to go outsideLila Sternoff from New York says it can be a great way for less social people to make friends:I think that its important to recognize that people socialize different ways and wanting to engage in an activity that they feel comfortable with Many young people make friends by playing a sport or participating in a after school activity and those are both great ways to make friends if that works for you but many children are just not interested in those activities and their participation would not be a positive experience for them Nobody ever calls a child who loves baseball a baseball addict in a negative way and I believe that no one should be criticized with the way that they enjoy themselves Fortnite is a positive outlet for children to play with friends feel strong and have something that they can be proud of accomplishing Fornite does not create addicts it creates enjoyable experiencesMekiyah Hazbin from Colorado, who has made many friends playing Fortnite, agrees:Hello My name is Mekiyah Hazbin I go to Liberty Middle school and I am currently in the th grade While Ive read many news articles and heard many opinions Some say games like Fortnite and PUBG are addicting and ruin social bonds I completely disagree When I began playing Fortnite it was mid October I didnt really play the game When I did I did it by myself Then in late December I went over to a friends house We played Fortnite together for hours I really began to like this game and by January it was one of my top games But I still didnt have anyone to play with That friend played Ps and I was on Xbox Thats when it hit my school Fortnite began to be in every conversation I found people I liked to play with People I wouldve never met if didnt play I met people out of state and out of country Yet we still play together and chat together as if weve known each other for years Fortnite is addicting because everyone want to be a winner They want to feel that sense of accomplishment They want to say Im better than other people If people continue to hate on those who play games they need to stop Discouraging someone from completing their goals is wrong Whether the goal is to become a super star or to finally get that victory royale no one should think they cant do somethingAnd as for the games violence? Jake M from NH has this to say:I have played Fortnite for almost months now and I have never seen violence being an issue in the game play There are guns in the game but the game is more like a game of virtual airsoft being that there is no blood and your character doesnt actually die but they get teleported off the island The game is more cartoony and humorous than violent The characters dance to send taunts and they have weapons like the boogey bomb which makes all the players that been hit by the bomb dance for seconds For comparison Fortnite is not much more violent than Tom and Jerry the kids cartoon Also kids these days are playing games like Grand Theft Auto where there is much more blood and violence than Fortnite So I dont think that Fortnite has too much violence and that it is suitable for younger peopleImageCreditArianna VairoOur Student Opinion prompt What Role Does Envy Play in Your Life asked students if feeling envious makes them want to work harder  or give up  and how it feels to be the envy of others.Tyler Skipworth from Oxford Miss has learned how to handle the emotion:My experience with envy has changed through my life It use to be that when I was little I had fought or tried to get what I wanted from someone like a toy Now when I see someone with something better then me I either go like good for you say how lucky they are compared to me or do my best to get where they are That last one is how I hope envy is a part of my adulthood when I grow up because I think it is a responsible way to use envy to your advantageMicah Cantor from Hastings on Hudson NY says accepting it is the best way to overcome it:I think that envy is directly related to competitiveness but it is often confused with jealousy which can occur without competition Under Aristotles definition that envy is the feeling of pain from others accomplishments I only feel that pain when comparing myself to a peer whom Im in competition with and not when comparing myself to a stranger This distinction is important because I dont think that a little bit of jealousy of a stranger or peer is a bad thing it only becomes dangerous when their accomplishments convert into personal feelings of anger or despair One of the ways to overcome hurtful feelings of envy is not to suppress it but accept it and realize that any comparison or competition between oneself and others is unnecessary Once the aspect of competition is relinquished the envy turns into simple admirationElla Thompson from Oxford Miss thinks envy is linked to approval:I think that envy relates to competitiveness mostly in sports Whenever someone comes before meet in a school cross country meet it seem that that person get congratulated more I might have been first for the team last meet but you failed this time and people think better of her That is how envy feels Envy continues to grow inside me Then is spend the next week training harder and harder just to beat soandso to get lots of approval I think that envy is linked to approval or praise in a way Whenever someone is getting more attention then me even though we did the same thing I get envious It is just our human nature This is why I agree that envy is related to competitiveness It might be bad or unsportsmanlike but it is true At least for meMolly Furman from HastingsonHudson says social media makes envy worse:I completely agree that social media is a huge source of envy because people typically only see or post the best moments snapshots of their lives Social Media has become a platform to brag about the new award you won the places you traveled to or the friendships you made or already had While social media is an amazing place to express ones individuality it also leads to people feeling insecure less than or extremely envious of a person they know of or a complete stranger It makes you take a step back when you realize how often people envy other peoples lives and stop living their own because they are attached to their screenDannielle Geneus from New Jersey understands when it most often afflicts her:Mostly when envy plays in my life its mostly because of looks When I see women that looks prettier than me it would bring me down at time I would just be likedang I wish I was like that then get mad jealousJordyn Ives from Westfield NJ says envy is a motivator:Whenever I envy somebody or something I am motivated to get whatever I was jealous of Even when I was little and saw a toy that another little girl had I saved up until I got my reward And now as a teenager I use the power of envy as a force in my everyday life If one of my friends gets a higher grade than me of course I would feel envy So when it came time to take the next exam I would think back to that moment and remember what it is that I want the higher grade This can be boiled down to competition because I have a desire to always be on topImageIn the presence of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre in Paris digital photography rather than looking at the painting has become the primary experienceCreditPedro FiuzaNurPhoto Sipa via Associated PressOur most eloquent responses this week may have come in reaction to our Student Opinion question Is the Digital Era Improving or Ruining the Experience of ArtMaddy Grosvenor from Leland Mich, thinks it should be experienced face-to-face:In my opinion I think art is best experienced in person Not that it is impossible for art to be appreciated online or in a book but to really gain the full experience I think it is best to see them in the flesh Many of the most famous artworks displayed in museums were made long before art was printed into books and posted on the internet The artists intention was for hisher audience to view them in person so would that not be the best way to appreciate them A piece of art that I would love to see in person would have to be a Jackson Pollock piece By looking at pictures of it online it is impossible to comprehend the sheer size and the presence it holds in a room This is one huge drawback you see with viewing art nowadays because so much of the art we see is online There is absolutely no way to get the full experience of a piece behind a screen However with the internet we can quickly and efficiently see art we would never be able to see without spending money on a plane ticket Still I think that the digital era is somewhat ruining the experience of viewing art It has made it more about visiting museums and having the I was there picture than actually appreciating and learning about the artColin Satterwhite from Leland Mich, agrees, saying art can evoke strong emotions:Prompt One I think art is meant to be experience in person I think the meaning of the art is magnified in person and captured in a way that couldnt be otherwise I think visual art should be seen in museums That way the viewer can get a personal impression of the work that isnt digital For me music is the most important form of art I know that Id rather see any song in person at a live concert than through my earbuds at home I think seeing music in person generates more emotion as you get the atmosphere of a crowd and its almost as though you get to interact with the artist and their music I think the type of art depends on whether the media should be viewed with a group or as an individual I think are is meant to be experience both intellectually and emotionally I think art is meant to appeal to all types of things Art can not only make you think about certain messages but also appeal to several emotions I think this is what makes art so special there is a type for every individualCobe Lund from MI says different art forms should be experienced in different ways:In my opinion different forms of art are meant to be experienced in different ways People can have a different outcome of feelings towards a work of art if their experience isnt the same as another persons I think works of art like the Mona Lisa are meant to be experienced in person individually and emotionally whereas works of art like dances are meant to be viewed online and in a group This is because so much detail can go into a painting and if its not inspected closely meaning can be lost On the other hand with works like dances the filming and production of the video can add to the overall routine Also a whole group can enjoy and try to participate as the work is playing Benefits of the digital era with art is editing production quality and easier sharing opportunities The main drawback is people trying to get the experience of art online that is meant to be viewed in person and up close Overall I think the digital era is improving the experience of art because technology has opened so many doors and possibilities to create new groundbreaking types of artNathanie Doralus from Florida believes it depends on the viewer:Art is meant to be experienced in whatever way is best for the viewer to fully receive the full effect and understanding intended by the artist Whether that method is in person online or in books depends on the viewer and their accessibility to the artwork I think the initial power lies in the artists hands to choose a format that they believe will reach and impact the most people Those people then obtain the power to share the art with others to experience it in different waysWorks of art I would like to see in person are the recent presidential portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC I want to experience this in person because I think that would be the best way to remember and revel in the existence of a black president and first lady of the United States whose portraits were created by black artists That kind of art is weighted in such a rich and painful history that I want to say I have seen with my own eyes in real life I have seen the portraits online and though it brought me so much joy it made me yearn to see it in person The digital images showed people witnessing the art for the first time in real life Their reactions prove that seeing it in person can have a great impact also The digital era was given artists the tools to share their creations with larger audiences Viewers have the right to seek other ways of experiencing art I would think the goal of artists would be to share it with the massesBut Mollie Grishaw from Leland Mich, says the best thing about art is that there are no rules for it:One of the most beautiful things about art is the fact that nothing about it is set in stone There are no definitive laws or theories like there are in the natural sciences Because of this variability art isnt meant to be experienced in any single way Some types of art are best experienced in a museum which creates a certain atmosphere of seriousness and formality Seeing the most famous art works in a museum is a very different experience than seeing them in a book or on a screen and to some the former might be the best way to experience them whereas for others it may be the latter It rests on the preferences of the beholder I once went to the Detroit Institute of Art and I could have easily spent innumerable hours there examining the artwork of different ages and areas It was a very different experience than seeing a painting on a screen It became more real more D This is definitely a drawback of the digital era We lose the physicality and dimensions of the world on the flat surface of our screens How can you ever be sure of the height of a mountain if you only ever see a picture On the other hand works of art have never been more accessible than they are now With simply the touch of a button and a few typed words you can view almost any work of art that you want With technology we are able to experience so much more art than if we had to travel to see it Thus the impact of the digital age on experiencing art can easily be argued both waysJessica Pershinske from Leland Mich, thinks the way artists make and share their art is changing with the times:As the digital age progresses and becomes more influential in our daytoday lives art has been forced to change its ways Originally a piece of art was meant to be observed in the flesh allowing us to view each brush stroke on the canvas Today art can come in nearly any form The ability to view art in person is no longer required Rather some art is created purely for its online availability Take a photographer that purely takes photos to be displayed online Does viewing these photos give us the same experience as viewing them in person would Probably not but to say that viewing them would have no worth at all would be to undermine the value of todays artists In this way art isnt simply meant to be experienced in one specific way Instead it takes the form of anything and everything and the way in which we view it changes our outlook on itEmiko Andrews from Wilmington NC, believes that the Internet is making physical art more sacred:While its disheartening to me that many people only choose to experience art by taking pictures of famous works I think its a sign of a shift in how we can view and create art in the st century Physical art done with oil paint on canvas is now joining other mediums like digital art and cartoons which can be distributed online along with pictures of traditional works of art I believe that this has caused us to see the physical works of art as something sacred that we must see just for the experience and take pictures to capture the memory As Li said I can see the Mona Lisa better in a book or on the internet Of course there are countless ways to experience art but it may be of value for us to take more time to consider what we really look for in art rather than just notoriety To summarize its my belief that in a time when art in all of its forms is so accessible we should look for art that has meaning for us not just that which has a famous name attachedAlice Ongaro from Leland Mich, sees both the benefits and drawbacks of art in the digital era:Everyones art experience is individual and experienced differently Art is not meant to be experienced in any specific way Your take about a piece of art is always going to be different from someone elses I consider Seeing art in person always better for example it makes me feel closer to the artist Also when I am looking at a work of art I know that what I am seeing is unique Seeing it in person gives value to the pieceI admit that sometimes I do visit museums just because an artwork that I am going to see is really famous But this does not mean that I cant appreciate it or that it does not transmit me any feelingsOf course right now there are some huge advantages involving art because of the digital era There is no need to travel or even to move to see art It could be a real advantage for someone who is unable or does not have opportunities to visit a museum But also I think that the fact that you only need a click to see a work of art takes value away from the artists jobImageJournalists protesting on World Press Freedom Day in Istanbul Press freedom in Turkey has sharply deteriorated under President Recep Tayyip ErdoganCreditMurad SezerReutersHow Important Is Freedom of the Press asked students if they get news from multiple sources, and if they think doing so is important. Students wrote in from New York and New Mexico, but also from Germany and Canada.Ashutosh Tamhankar from Munich says the world needs a dissenting press:A free press is like a catalyst in a democratic society Journalism offers a common ground for ideas to be discussed from diverse points of views and promoting a dialogSo that people can form their own opinions values like impartiality truth and accuracy should play a key role in the media If the radio reports that the German government decides to swith off nuclear energy it has to make sure the facts are right the opinion reported is not misrepresented and that the pros and cons of this idea are presented to the audienceTo support a liberal society that respects diversity fairness and peace we need a dissenting press Demagogues will enjoy impunity with the lack of free press if they are successful in silencing a critical voice in the society Miss Turkey got into trouble by writing a poem that critiqued Mr Erdogan Such instances will continue to happen if press is allowed to be intimidated by these democratators Freedom of speech shouldnt be misunderstood to be freedom to offend Journalists are accountable to a pluralistic audience that trusts the press as a source of information to form their views The press thus has a huge responsibility in keeping a healthy discourse alive to keep democracy aliveMahir from DYC CLIP says news empowers others:Though it may be interesting or even entertaining the foremost value of news is as a utility to empower the informed The purpose of journalism is thus to provide citizens with the information they need to make the best possible decisions about their lives their communities their societies and their governments News is that part of communication that keeps us informed of the changing events issues and characters in the world outside Though it may be interesting or even entertaining the foremost value of news is as a utility to empower the informedKyla Navarro from Las Cruces NM is concerned about the suppression of a free press:Since the Presidential Election Ive come to realize that the media is incredibly important Journalism is a line of defense against a powerful government it is essential to democracy to be aware of what our elected officials are doing As someone who supports a lot of government regulation I dont think news outlets should be censored in any way My peers insist on the government mitigating news outlets rather than being responsible aware and critical of the information they consume online or on television Censoring the freedom of the press and free speech is also interfering with the first amendment rights of Americans so what stops the government from stopping people to peacefully protest or worship whichever gods they believe in I do agree that President Trump is a threat to the free press and I dont think democratic leaders should denounce the media Leaders should be aware how essential it is to the people they have sworn to serve to be aware of the good and the bad of their policies not everyone wins in politics people have to compromiseMarcelo from DYC CLIP thinks a free press is important, even though, he says, reporters can be too aggressive:I think that the freedom of press is important until a certain point the press does not have to have the freedom to do whatever they want or to say whatever they want to say because everyone knows how harassing some reporters can be it is true that their work is important to keep us informed about things that happened around the worldRuth from DYC CLIP insists a free press should be worldwide:In my opinion the purpose of journalism is offers enough information to all of us It is important for all people in our country to know more about what happen in each place Journalism is a means of information very important Journalists should have absolute freedom of speech everywhere in the worldDevlin Korr from Ontario Canada highlights a case study for journalistic ethics:Soft censorship by media outlets is a serious problem that does not get enough attention Sometimes agents of the state andor corporate entities make it difficult for journalists to report the facts or act impartiallyConsider the case of Bela Kosoian the woman who was handcuffed and fined for not holding an escalator handrail and obstructing police in the performance of their duties The incident was all over the news in Journalists at the time sided with the police saying they were merely enforcing an STM bylaw Had they done their due diligence instead of acting like cheerleaders for the police they would have discovered there is no regulation requiring commuters to hold the handrail not then not now Ms Kosoian contested her tickets in municipal court and won News of her victory was never reported to the masses whom to this very day live in ignorance of the injustice that was done to her and by extension to themselves She is currently going the route of social media with a campaign called becomesmany to raise awareness of her challenge to the Supreme Court of Canada on a related matter She has a Wix blog with an entry called Yes Real life can be stranger than fiction which will give you cause to question the integrity of our socalled free pressImageInstagram owned by Facebook is expanding its antibullying initiative in an effort to rid the popular social media site of bulliesCreditChandan KhannaAgence FrancePresseNearly all students who responded to our Picture Prompt on cyberbullying said that it happens regularly and that social media companies should do something about it.Kayla Renee from Pennsylvania says it happens every day:Cyberbullying is a nationwide issue and ranges among all ages not just teenagers I have never been bullied over the internet but its something that most kids my age face everyday I feel as if social media apps arent doing as much as they can for the children and young adults being tormented from cyberbullying It happens too often for nothing to be changing The most common apps where people cyberbully would be Facebook and Instagram Facebook and Instagram can do a lot more then they are now about addressing this problemLexie Smith from Oxford has been a victim of cyberbullying, and thinks jokes often go too far:Students love to conceal their embarrassment or the shame of being bullied I honestly believe that snapchat is where most of the cyber bullying take place Most students ponder that since snap chat post disappear after hours that it doesnt matter which is false I do feel as if social media companies should try to filter what is posted or commented No one should feel harassed on social media and I think that they should try to remove the negative comments and etc For example have someone watch over pages I think that some students are just trying to crack a joke but takes that joke a little to far I am aware of cyber bullying knowing the fact that at one point I was a victim of cyber bullying I know that the act of bullying will not cease but I think that their should be more that we can doDorothy Daniels from Oxford Miss says Instagram does a good job of removing offending posts promptly:I think Instagram is doing good recognizing and taking action when cyberbullying is spotted To do even better Instagram and other social media platforms should encourage users to report cyberbullying Personally I found that people feel intrusive or in other peoples business when they report abusive hurtful comments On one specific post I saw a younger girl getting attacked for supporting a highly disliked celebrity I reported the comments and they were removed within hours I feel like most social media is doing really well recognizing and fighting against cyberbullyingBella from Oxford Miss thinks everyone deserves to be treated fairly:I think cyberbullying is a problem for some people They feel more comfortable doing it behind a screen instead of in person This does not happen to me but for many other people it does It happens on any app where you can talk to another person Peoples feelings get hurt often because others are mean to them The people that cyberbully have probably been bullied before so they do it to make them feel better about themselves A person is most likely to scared to tell someone about it so the bully takes advantage of that and does not stop Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and no one should have to go through thatImageIn a minute conversation filmed at Kanye Wests California home on April the rapper spoke about controversies aspirations and regrets A more emotional interview on TMZ was posted Tuesday as wellComments were wide-ranging, respectful, and thoughtful in answer to our question How Much Do a Celebritys Personal Beliefs Influence Your Opinion of Their Work which was inspired by Kanye Wests recent statementsKyndall from Virginia has a strong reaction to Mr. West:My reaction to Kanyes comments is that of disgust and disregard I agree with the widespread denunciation Celebrities personal opinions depending on the topic do not necessarily influence my opinion of their work but they do influence my support of themIve stopped listening to many artists because of what theyve said and what theyve done regardless of my initial positive feelings about their work I dont want to endorse a person who espouses hateful views or plain ignorance I dont think separating the art from the artist applies to modern public figures who should understand the significance of their comments and actions Its easy for people like Mr Leibovitz to minimize Kanyes rhetoric as a mere opinion But while some have the privilege of ignoring politics others are affected daily by its consequences which is why I dont understand how the endorsement of a man with staunch support from white supremacists should be tolerated and overlooked as simply a different viewpoint This freethinking is dangerous because it normalizes the racism Kanye has internalized and gives credibility to those who believe in these ideas People shouldnt be given a pass because others perceive them as creative and insightful Kanyes pseudointellectual comments especially as a proud nonreader of books are the direct opposite of insight and they should be held accountable especially when their missteps arent actually mistakes but intentional choices they makeSam from Boston says part of Mr. Wests greatness is his refusal to keep with the norm:Kanye West has never been the kind of person to withhold what he thinks from the media because it would cause controversy In the recent TMZ interview that he took part in he made the comment that looking back now after hundreds of years slavery is a choice which immediately caused outrageAlthough his comments are unpopular in the public eye in my opinion it should not harbor an effect on the enjoyment of his musical or fashion endeavors West has the right to say what he believes and for people to attempt to boycott his music and to cause such an uproar because of the fact that he is in the public eye I enjoy Wests music separate from whether I agree or disagree with his political or other public views One of the things that makes Kanye the great artist that he is is his edge and refusal to keep with the norm He is entitled to his opinion and in my opinion for Kanye to say something of this nature is not extremely surprisingQuin from The Governors Academy feels strongly that freedom of expression is a right for all Americans:Although I was surprised by what Kanye West said during his interview I like hearing what celebrities have to say about topics that dont have anything to do with their profession You never know what they are gonna say Kanye is a musician and an entertainer I have never unfollowed a celebrity on social media because of their political views If their beliefs influence their work I would still follow them Its part of who they areAfter listening to Kanyes interview on TMZ it made me realize that even though Kanyes comments on slavery were very shocking he has the right to express his feelings I understand that some people were offended by what he said He is famous and he has a lot of influence but people have the right to criticism him unfollow him or to boycott his products and music if they want Freedom of expression is a right of all Americans Kanye said in his interview that he admires Trump because he proved that anything is possible in America I can understand how Kanye can relate to Trump as an outsider Kanyes interview shows how important it is to have conversations about controversial issues Everyone has their own opinions no matter how different they are we should listen so that we can understand where people are coming from even if we dont agree with them Artists and people need to be free to express themselves its one of the things that makes America great even if we disagree with what they sayAzjan Ransome from Byfield Mass encourages interaction with people of varying opinions:Personally Im glad that Kanye West is sharing his opinion The right to free expression is everyones and Kanye is not exempt The public response was unfair having an unpopular opinion does not make someone crazy but the right is entitled to their opinion as well Its human nature to put people in boxesAs Mr West states in his TMZ interview he is an artist a musician and a black person but his opinions do not have to align with other members of that group It is not his responsibility to represent anyone besides himself and his company The most human thing that Kanye or any artist can do is express their unique perspectiveA celebrities personal beliefs their political leanings philosophical stances perspectives on the world and their causes should not be considered when deciding the quality of their work Simultaneously artists work should not be independent of who they are If you dont like what someone stands for then go find other entertainers I would never delete a celebrities social media or not watch their performances because their opinions dont align with mine I believe it is important to interact with and receive the opinions of people who you dont agree with Peoples personal beliefs have never changed my feelings about their work I agree with Mr Leibowitzs statement because free expression is a right of all americansShania Sylvain from Apopka is personally hurt at the rappers comments on slavery:When people say that Kanye is in the Sunken Place I honestly found it as a joke but now Im starting to think this statement is true I feel as many others do that hes only doing this because he has music coming out Kanye is known for acting a fool when he has something coming out so that it brings him a much attention But as far as his very surprising remarks on slavery I am honestly extremely hurt taken back and disgust Being imprisoned is not a choose We have to keep in mind that many of those slaves made tough decisions like taking their lives and risking running away killing masters and rebelling So the statement about choosing to to be slaves and being mental imprisoned was very recklessKyle Gaffey says no person should be treated poorly for his beliefs:After returning from his one year mental cool down Kanye West has returned to the public eye in a very thought provoking way Personally I believe that Mr Wests comments could offend many people but I cant say I feel personally attacked by his ideals He believes the words he is speaking and he is entitled to his opinion The public can comment on his views but I believe that nobody should be attempting to conform him because of the influence he holds over people Kanye West has millions of fans that will listen to what he says but people who challenge his views have no right to say he shouldnt believe what he wants West is challenging the social norm and he doesnt deserve to be treated poorly based off his beliefs no person doesHeaven from Massachusetts feels that, in the end, she cannot support an artist who offends:Just like every other person Kanye is entitled to his own opinion but when youre in a position of status or power you have to be conscious of the impact of your words In regards to Mr West showing his support for Trump although I do not support Trump in any way that is his choice and option to do so However when stating that years of slavery was a choice there was a clear lack of thought behind what he was saying He completely dismissed the mental and physical brutality of slavery and the repercussions of it against black people throughout history from Jim Crow era to police brutalityI wouldnt have had as big of a problem with it if Kanye offered an explanation but his statement seemed as if there was little or no thought to back it up Kanye is a great artist that many look up to however he has to realize that what he says has an effect on everyoneIn general for me an artists work and beliefs go hand in hand If something they support goes against what I stand for morally I can not continue to support them because at the end of the day there are plenty of artists and musicians that I can enjoy That doesnt mean they themselves are a bad person or their work is bad but it would be hypocritical for me to say one thing while supporting artists with morals that do not align with my ownPat Flaherty from Byfield Mass understands the connection between Kanye and President Trump:Kanye West is notorious for speaking out against the norm and having an abstract point of view After listening to Kanyes interview I was intrigued by his mindset and the way he views big political matters Kanye was recently seen wearing a Make America Great Again hat and when asked about it he replied It was just what I was feeling that day He then said how he likes Trump and how he was considered an outsider in the presidential campaign and ended up becoming president Kanye enjoyed the fact that an outsider infiltrated and won the election Kanye unlike many other rappers likes Trump and is intrigued by the way he handles things Kanye also likes Trump because of how he uses his platform to speak directly to the people and how the people have no fear in speaking back Kanye believes that Trump has allowed Americans to speak out and feel comfortable doing soImageCreditAist StancikaitStudents write short stories and poems in response to the Picture Prompt, Four ItemsBrianne from New Hampshire composes a farewell

      "b'AdvertisementOpinionSupported byPaul Krugman Explains Trade and TariffsBy Paul KrugmanMarch ImageNear a coke manufacturing plant in PennsylvaniaCreditAndrew HarrerBloombergPaul Krugman took questions from readers about trade after President Trumps announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports Here are his answers to some of the hundreds of questions he received By the Editors Literally every small consumer item I buy is made in China Please explain how this came to be and whether you think we can or should take steps to change it Should all manufacturing jobs flow to the lowestcost lowestwage environments regardless of working conditions or environmental impacts If not how can a freetrade system prevent this The government of China is subsidizing the growth of its electric car industry by providing very significant subsidies about onethird of cost to consumers This subsidy will allow the industry to scale up much more quickly and produce electric cars cheaper than anyone else In a freetrade world is this good planning or cheating Nick Van Kleeck Tucson ArizPaul Krugman 1. Its partly a sort of optical illusion. China dominates assembly of many goods thanks to a combination of still-low wages and an extensive industrial ecology of supporting firms. But much of the value of the good actually comes from elsewhere. For example, iPhones are made in China, but China only accounts for less than 4 percent of their price. Not entirely theres some room for insisting on basic working conditions and environmental rules But not too much Consider Bangladesh all it really has is a large labor force with fairly low productivity Low wages are the only way they can sell on world markets If we insist that they follow firstworld rules were basically telling them to go starve3. Its tricky. Subsidizing consumers is O.K. under the rules, while subsidizing producers isnt. If the U.S. offered tax breaks for electric cars, it would be perfectly legal under W.T.O. rules. The trouble is that given Chinese reality, youre not going to see a lot of foreign electric cars sold there. But as these things go, its not a particularly egregious example.I remember in undergraduate school studying President Kennedys Trade Expansion Act of This was in a political economics class What was the significance of this act and was it bipartisan Also recommend some readings on political economics Morgan Rauch Houston TexPK It was bipartisan, and really a continuation of the process of reciprocal trade liberalization that began in 1934 under F.D.R. What changed under the Kennedy Round was that as easy targets for trade deals ran out, we shifted to internationally agreed formulas: cut all tariffs by X percent, then negotiate the exemptions. But most of the heavy lifting in tariff reduction had already happened.ImageA steelworker in PennsylvaniaCreditMichael MathesAgence FrancePresse Getty ImagesMy question How will American steel workers fare as a result of this tariff I heard the head of a steel workers union on NPR welcome this tariff and he sounded as if their prayers have been answered James C BrooklynPK We will gain a few jobs in steel. But well lose jobs in lots of other, downstream industries like autos. Most studies of the 2002 steel tariffs say that they cost jobs on net. So yes, steel workers get a little, but at what cost to other workers?I live very near a HUGE rustedout steel plant Bethlehem Steel in Steelton Pa I came here years ago and it had already started its long sad road to its present obsolescence Trump described this phenomenon in his rollout He then had union workers talk about the production reductions to percent from the heyday of domestic steel productionWhat source of funding could possibly come in and want to turn this mile row of rusted barned eyesore around Billions of dollars of investment would be necessary The ideas of Making America Great Again seem to be based in recreating the economy of the s s and s This and the return of coal to the high ridges of Pennsylvania seem a distant memory Is revitalization of these old industries even a possibility Arent the jobs from the Rust Belt too expensive to get back Or would another communitys landscape be blighted instead CC New Cumberland Pa PK Theres no way to bring back all those steel plants and steel jobs, even if we stopped all imports. Partly thats because a modern economy doesnt use that much steel, partly because we can produce steel using many fewer workers, partly because old-fashioned open-hearth plants have been replaced by mini-mills that use scrap metal and arent in the same places. So this is all a fantasy.What is your critique of the antitrade argument made by the WarrenSanders wing of the Democratic Party that free trade has been bad for the proverbial American worker and has been a significant contributor to Americas rising income and wealth inequality Is the answer simply that the benefits of free trade lower prices generally are diffuse and therefore underappreciated whereas the costs worker dislocation in particular sectors are concentrated and thus easier to highlight How much of Americas increase in income inequality over the past halfcentury do you attribute to free tradeThank you for addressing this JG in CT Greenwich Conn How should we deal with the deindustrialization and loss of community that free trade has been causing If tariffs are not the answer what policies would you recommend L Marcus New YorkPK Theres some truth to the argument that growing trade has contributed to rising inequality; if imports of manufactures from developing countries were still as low as they were in, say, 1970, real wages of blue-collar workers would probably be a few percent higher than they are.But the level of protectionism it would take to get those few percent back would have lots of ugly side consequences If we want to help UD workers and we do there are better waysYou may remember Bernie Sanders using Denmark as an example Its a good one much better wages a much stronger social safety net a mostly unionized work force But Denmark is as open to world trade as we are Its domestic policies from taxing and spending decisions to prolabor policies in the service sector that make the difference Universal health care and the right to organize matter a lot more for workers than trade policyWhy does the president of the United States have the authority to make decisions such as imposing tariffs that have significant impacts on the economy trade relationships with allies etc with impunity and with no input from Congress What path should Congress be taking to restrict his powers Ricky Saint Paul, Minn.PK Actually, Congress voluntarily limited its own role, to protect itself from special-interest politics: it votes big trade deals up or down on a single vote, then stays out of it. But given the realities of trade tensions, the system needs some escape valves  ways to provide temporary relief in hard cases. Thats why the president has certain ways he can impose tariffs: if theres a finding that an industry has been injured by an import surge, if national security is at stake, if foreigners pursue unfair practices.However these powers arent supposed to be used arbitrarily theres supposed to be an independent study of the issue and the president acts on the basis of that study Whats happening with Trump is an abuse of the process the Commerce Department came up with an obviously bogus national security rationale for tariffs Trump wanted to impose for other reasonsSo we have a process that gives presidents some discretion for pretty good reasons but one that assumes that said presidents will act honestly and responsibly It falls apart when youre dealing with someone like TrumpWill we be able to undo this after this administration is voted out Or does this have far too many longterm effects Stephanie Minister Hingham MassPK President Oprah Winfrey, or whoever, can undo these tariffs with a stroke of the pen. However, we might get into a full-scale trade war before that happens, and in any case the U.S. has already lost its reputation as a reliable negotiating partner.My question is What role does free trade play in income inequality and the concentration of wealth in a global economy I have little doubt that trade creates value On average everyone ends up wealthier with free trade better allocation of resourcesRarely do I see the unequal distribution of the value created by trade addressed Sure bluecollar workers all enjoy lower prices on apparel at Walmart with lowcost textiles from China but some worker lost a hour job in a US textile mill and the Walmart saving doesnt offset the hour job for that displaced worker The downside of free trade is concentrated onto a relatively small group of peopleI also believe that financiers and the capital class keep a large part of the savings when US jobs are sent offshore and individual workers with limited geographical scope pay a priceTo me the question isnt IF trade creates wealth but for whom is the wealth created Tom Stoltz DetroitPK Theres been a lot of work on this question over the years. Back in I estimated that trade widened the gap between college and non-college workers by 3 percent, and that number has surely risen since, though maybe only a couple of points. By the way, the downside affects a lot of people, not just a small group.We also think that the surge in imports between 2000 and 2007 displaced something like a million workers. Most of those workers eventually found other jobs, but many faced wage cuts and some communities got hurt badly.So this isnt a subject economists have been ignoring You just want to ask whats the best way to help workers and tariffs are rarely the answerIs a perennial and rising trade deficit desirable and even sustainable in the very long run Much of our debt is now owned by other countries see China and Japan for example Are we not giving away ownership of our of national wealth to our trading partners I am in favor of free trade but I was always puzzled by the decadeslong rising trade deficit Germany for example a Western democracy manages to have a trade surplus with the help of the euro of course but they still make goods people want even outside the eurozone I have read explanations that the privilege of having a reserve currency has a price which is maintaining trade surpluses and this in turn allows for lower interest rates and higher growth Sounds interesting but still can we make the case that the rising debt is sustainable for the long run What is your view Costa Glaretas PK Basically, we have persistent trade deficits because we have low savings and remain an attractive place for foreigners to invest. And as a result, the U.S., which was a creditor country before we began running persistent deficits since 1980, is now a net debtor.But you want to keep some perspective Our net international investment position overseas assets less liabilities is about percent of GDP which isnt that big a number all things considered For example its less than percent of our national wealthAnd the idea that this gives foreigners a lot of power over America has it backward On the contrary in a way it makes them our hostages China has a lot of money tied up in America Suppose they tried to pull it out the worst that could happen would be a fall in the dollar which would be good for US manufacturing and inflict a capital loss on our creditorsLot of things worry me our foreign debt not so muchPerhaps something else is going on For example steel and aluminum are key industries in Pittsburgh home of Alcoa Could the need to stop a string of Democratic midterm victories play a role in the timing and choice of targets for these tariffs Peter San Mateo CalifPK Quite possibly. We know thats why Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002. But I think this is mostly Trump trying to look tough. At a guess, Stormy Daniels had a bigger impact than PA-18.Clearly global trade is too complicated for Donald Trump to fathom But Paul Krugman No Not too complicated So pretend you are in his position but with your knowledge and insight What would you do regarding trade Top three playspasses Jack NashvillePK Basically, U.S. trade policy is O.K. The old days of lots of manufacturing jobs arent coming back whatever we do, and trying to save a few of them by ripping up trade rules would have lots of nasty side effects.I was against TPP but not because I want a return to protectionism the trouble with TPP was that it wasnt about trade at all it was mainly about intellectual property eg pharma patents and dispute settlement giving corporations more powerWhat we need is a renewed commitment to universal health care much more investment in infrastructure policies to help families and a return to policies that empower unions especially in the service sector Defining trade as the problem is just a way to duck real solutionsWhat are the worstcase repercussions of these tariffs when our trade partners retaliate Donald Ferruzzi Centereach NYPK In the short run, theres a huge amount of disruption: wed eventually gain jobs in import-competing industries, but wed immediately lose a lot of jobs both in export sectors (including farming) and in industries that are currently part of global supply chains, like autos and electronics. So wed be talking about millions of immediate losers, even if some would eventually gain.In the longer run the economy would just be less efficient instead of concentrating on stuff were especially good at wed be doing a lot of laborintensive stuff for ourselves I havent seen a good estimate of just how much poorer but it would surely be worse than Brexit which typical estimates say will make Britain about percent poorerWere not talking the end of the world or even a major depression here Just a big shortterm mess and a longerterm drag on economic growthWhat part do disparate wages and benefits paid to workers by the various trading nations play in trade policy if any If Country A can because of low wages produce a product at half or less the cost of Country B how can trade without tariffs ever be fair abigail GaPK What you need to ask is why wages are so much lower in some countries than they are here. The answer is that they have much lower overall productivity  globally, the relationship between productivity and average wages is pretty close to one-for-one. So when you look at low-wage countries, they have a big cost advantage in sectors like clothing where their productivity isnt too much lower than ours, but a big cost disadvantage in higher-tech sectors.Remember Germany which runs the worlds biggest trade surplus actually pays substantially higher wages than we doImageShipping containers at the Port of Long BeachCreditLucy NicholsonReutersJust a thought from a US contractorAt Home Depot and Lowes its essentially impossible to find a steel hand tool hammer saw chisel screwdriver etc or electric tool that is NOT made in China Taiwan or Mexico In addition the quality of that foreign steel is clearly inferior subject to fast oxidation rusting or actual fracture Although the few Americanmade tools available are somewhat more expensive those of us who want something to last buy American IF you can find it Its a sad state of affairs that we cant compete with the imports even though our production quality is far superior to foreign steel Will the tariffs fix this No clue LJM, Cape Cod, Mass.PK If people are buying inferior foreign products, isnt that their choice? Maybe they care more about low prices than quality. Its kind of like buying fresh but expensive local produce: I prefer it, but Im affluent enough to make that choice. Many people arent.Im interested in the analysis of the mechanics of such decisions worldwide especially for third world economies rather than the important political conflicts among nations that you mentioned in your excellent article Wail Fahmi BedawiPK It all depends on how widespread the trade conflict gets. I often focus on the example of Bangladesh, where people used to predict mass deaths from starvation due to overpopulation, but its currently keeping its head above water and even achieving significant growth (from a very low base) thanks to open world markets that let it export lots of clothing. If we do have a full-scale trade war, the impact on places like Bangladesh will be devastating if not deadly.How much damage should we expect these tariffs to do to the economy and the markets Will they affect some regions of the US more than others Im a public employee and Im wondering about state tax receipts UCB Parent Calif PK By themselves, the steel and aluminum tariffs arent that big a deal. Consumers wont notice them much; some auto plants, etc., that might have opened will be canceled, but I dont expect to see any existing plants closed. Revenue effects will also be small.But if this turns into titfortat with Europe retaliating and Trump retaliating back who knowsQuestions How will the tariffs affect EU countries Will they weaken the NATO alliance What impact will the tariffs have on England going into Brexit Will the TPP countries fare better for their new trade agreement Which countries are likely to fare better because of Trumps tariffs Mary M Raleigh NCPK This is all pretty small stuff so far: the E.U. is as big an economy as ours is, so its marginal there as here. I dont think it affects the Brexit calculus at all. If Canada doesnt get a sustained exemption, its a bigger deal: theyre a fairly small economy that supplies most of our aluminum imports.For now the bigger impact is on foreign relations now nobody trusts us and China and Russia are the big winners from that distrustHow is it that so many economists of all political stripes agree that protective tariffs are bad Up until the SmootHawley tariff debacle of the s werent tariffs a fairly common economic policy prescription Did the Great Depression unfairly give tariffs a bad name or did the field of economics just advance beyond tariffs as part of the economic policy tool kit Jason Williams Washington DCPK Actually, economists were overwhelmingly against SmootHawley. There has always been a minority view supporting tariffs under certain circumstances  usually for economic development. But the failure of import-substituting industrialization in Latin America and India largely discredited that view.Please respond to Daniel McCarthys OpEd pointforpoint His arguments are very convincing but counter to yours Someone is drinking cool aid here and without an authentic debate its impossible to know which position is less selfserving Michael ChicagoPK Many readers asked a version of this question. McCarthys whole article is premised on the notion that protectionism can bring back a manufacturing-centered economy. I couldnt find any facts at all about trade in his article, certainly no numbers.And if you actually do look at the numbers, you immediately realize that his whole premise is wrong: we could shut down trade completely and manufacturing would still employ less than percent of the work force.So Im not sure what to argue with He didnt do his homeworkDr Krugman assuming a reasonable fair and level playing field wouldnt a worldwide freetrade agreement benefit all of humanity It would seem that products and services would be produced by the best and the most efficient andor the closest in proximity to resources whether human or earth bornThe EU is moving ahead with the TTP Will this cripple US trade in Asia Steve SeattlePK TPP wont make that much difference to trade, since it wasnt mostly about trade (it was about intellectual property and dispute settlement). Im less worried about the U.S. loss of trade than our loss of influence: were a less and less credible negotiating partner. Follow me on Twitter (PaulKrugman) and Facebook.

      "b'AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationSelfexpression Procrastination Breakdancing and Childhood Bedrooms Our Favorite Student Comments of the WeekImageOur Picture Prompt Childhood Bedroom used this related photo essay to ask students what the items in their bedroom say about each of them as a person.By The Learning NetworkMay Last week we asked students to post suggested topics for a writing prompt, and Xander Kruvczuk from the United States of America did:I have an idea for a daily prompt This seems like something that this publisher has already used but if it hasnt been used yet Id like to recommend seeing how it goes Can you hate what an artist what they stand for or what they believe in but still enjoy what they create This topic seems like it would have been covered during the Harvey Weinstein controversy but I recently saw something that made me think of it Kanye West posted on his Twitter that he supports Donald Trump Not even a day later he had lost million of his followers It made me think of how fickle some people are and what they actually like about certain artistsNow, it later turned out that Kanye did not lose million followers, but we loved the idea in general. This week it became the question, How Much Do a Celebritys Personal Beliefs Influence Your Opinion of Their Work Let us, and Xander, know what you think.And if you have ideas for a writing prompt, well be posting a new one every school day from now through early June, so please let us know.But if youve been participating in our forums all year, its time to step up your game. Weve just announced our Ninth Annual New York Times Summer Reading Contest, and we hope youll join us.It runs for weeks from June to Aug and all you have to do to enter is just answer the question What interested you most in The Times this weekAs we do here, well choose favorites every week ... except in the summer we ask journalists from around the newsroom to help, and we crown just one top winner every Tuesday (though we also recognize many runners-up and honorable mentions). So if youve been feeling hemmed in by waiting to see what articles we choose, nows your chance to choose your own.Now enjoy this weeks selectionPlease note All student comments have been lightly edited for length but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submittedImageCreditThomas PatersonOur most popular prompt, Is School a Place for SelfExpression asked teenagers how much they reveal about their true selves in their work for teachers. The responses were fascinating.Polaris Hall from Danvers High School Mass argues that school should be a place to learn about yourself:School isnt the place for selfexpression but it should be Teachers often tell students that they should show their personality in their work but then deem it unprofessional or distracting how is that supposed to encourage us Kids and teenagers alike need to express themselves to their peers their teachers and their communities especially when they arent accepted at home A school is not only a place for learning facts its a place to learn more about yourself and about how you relate to the world around you while being supported by people who care why else would a teacher choose that job Allowing kids to learn these skills and supporting them as they do so yields adults who know how to bring passion into their lives even if they have a job theyd love to quit Of course there are teachers who love to see kids grow and figure out how to be themselves in a safe joyful way but so often our need to meet a certain standard or rubric leads us to abandon our individuality Its a sad world if the push for perfection quashes the vibrancy of selfexpression Instead we should let this drive for selfimprovement be enhanced by our individuality to create a richer happier worldShelby Johnson from Massachusetts thinks assignments need to be more open-ended:In school many students feel detached from their studies I hear complaints all around me about how boring assignments are and how much students dislike memorizing facts about distant topics We are constantly bombarded with work that is not relatable to our interests and is very structuredHowever some assignments are more openended and I think that these are the pieces of work that students can learn the most from Depending on the topic of work certain classes allow for projects in which students can choose what they would like to study and then apply the information from the class to their own personal interests When these assignments are given it is much more common for students to be truly interested and invested in their workWhile I rarely hear fellow students gushing excitedly about the assignment that every single person had to complete in the same way when delving into something that they actually care about people tend to be more excited about their learningBrianna Colangelo from Concord NC says only one kind of class encourages expression:I feel that school shuts down selfexpression by dress coding people for wearing things they are comfortable or confident in by making you do everything exactly the way the teacher wants it or else getting a bad grade judging your intelligence on questions that have one exact answer that the teacher is looking for At my school i dont have a chance to ever express my culture my family or my personality The only time at my school that i get to express my experiences and ideas are in my AP classes in my AP classes i feel as though the teachers care more and they dont just ask questions with one answer i feel like those teachers are genuinely trying to help me learn understand and voice my opinions not just get their paycheck and leaveJulia Patrum from Concord says its easy to start feeling like a number at school:Personally I do not consider school to be a place where I find myself flourishing on a personal level The person I am is not really how I am at school at all I feel like this is the case for most high school students as well Aside from my personal friends at school my peers dont really have a true glimpse at how I am as a personThis may be due to the lack of encouragement in bringing your personal lives to the school environmentWe learn so much throughout the course of our four years in high school but only a small portion of that will be actually useful in the future We are not encouraged to find ourselves or express as people while in school It is easy to start feeling like a number rather than a person sometimes and thats the sad truth of it allLiam Breen from Danvers Mass believes clothing, clubs and assignments provide opportunity:I believe that while the idea of school itself isnt exactly a place for selfexpression schools often can be a place for selfexpression if students choose to express themselves I attend Danvers High School where like most public high schools there is not a strict or severe dress code enabling the students to express themselves through what clothing they choose to wear Furthermore students can express themselves in their classes when participating in creative assignments we are occasionally allowed to relate our work back to a subject we are interested in as I wrote an argument in my AP English class discussing the pros and cons of Joe Montana and Tom Brady Additionally students are allowed to express themselves with the people they choose to spend time with and the people they are associated with My school has a large amount of clubs and sports teams that students may participate on and in choosing what sport they play or what club they are a member of students are expressing their interests and who they are as a personTia Terrian from St Cloud High School Fla feels most expressive at home:My home is where I feel best able to express myself There I am surrounded by family I know we have seen all of each others sides the good the bad and the ugly We may tease each other but we are always accepting of one another no mater how crazy we are We have grown up together and they have had my back through everything My family has seen me at two in the morning bouncing all over the walls and seen me at in the morning looking completely dead as i get ready for school They already know how I act and look in most situations and nothing surprises them anymore My family has been there for everything and I know that no matter what they will always be there I convey my thoughts questions ideas and emotions very loudly at home and chaotic I know that my family is the same and we may seem crazy and out of control to anyone outsider lolking in but we get each other and we like it that wayEliza Gmez St Cloud High School Fla gives a shout-out to the one teacher who allows her to express herself:In my opinion I do not feel like I have had the freedom to express myself at school as I will want to due to many factors First you as student can easily get judged by others even by teachers when you do not agree with their ideas and opinions Second when you try to express your opinions emotions or feelings there is always someone against it Most of the times I do feel like our ideas are not appreciated in school they may ask our opinions but we are not going to see changes due to our ideas We havent had freedom to express our personalities culture and ideas at school because we are forced to a certain way of writing and as the article says somewhere along the way these young people were told by teachers that who they are in their writing ought to be divorced from who they are on their phones paragraph Students are not only someone else in their writing but at some point even prohibited to use the word I in essays lacking the opportunity to express themselvesAlthough most classes dont give students the opportunity to express themselves the only class that have fully given me as a student the opportunity to express not only my ideas and opinions but also my culture has been Freshaman Composition class taught by Mrs Martin Nora from Oxford Miss credits journalism class with encouraging expression:I only feel that my personality culture family experiences and ideas are appreciated in journalism We have many opportunities to write about things we like and express ourselves in creative formats Such as the editorials we are writing and the bellringers we do everyday In other classes like reading we could instead of having essays with prompts we could write about our family and culture and maybe even have an open discussion about topics and issues going on in our communityIsabella from Maine says English class gives students a chance to talk about their feelings:In English class we sometimes are asked about our feelings in the moment or about a topic and at times we are asked a tricky question and have to give our best answer This just gives us a chance to write our opinion and feelings We are also asked to just write about what happened over the weekend or vacation so it emerges in a school work quite enough I personally like writing about personal and my own lifeMakayla from Oxford Miss thinks the people within a school are what make it expressive:School is where the majority of kids spend their days To me I feel like school is a place for selfexpression I say this because of the different races culture and language thats distributed throughout the school The overall diversity that a school house contains is what makes it full of expression After reading the article I can say that I was somewhat able to question and articulate devotions frustrations little triumphs and large peculiarities because they all deal with selfexpression and how I carry myself I could say that onefourth of what I care about outside of school does involve inside of school because I tend to lean more on what I know from the outside to learn more about on the inside All in all expression and school was rebooted in my mindAnd a noobie teacher, Liza M from Seattle WA gives her perspective:As a noobie teacher who got picked to teach the other English teachers least favorite class college prep writing I often feel pressed to quelch creative expression for the sake of formal academic writing Though my heart is in creative nonfiction prose and countless genres of fiction I am required to create curriculum that teaches all students from the potential engineer to nurses to artists how to communicate persuasively and effectively in writing With the common core standards and emphasis on reading nonfiction and writing persuasively I always get nervous about seeing too many I statements in the papers I receiveIts a hard balance to teach how to put your unique imprint on an academic piece but I know it can be done Most of todays everyday readers arent reading heavily structured academic pieces unless theyre in school studying specialized knowledge theyre reading the op ed columns arguments in the comments and articles about topics they are interested in Not just that theyre looking for writing that catches their attention and keeps it Im not setting my students up for success to be such writers if I dont allow them some creative selfexpression so Mr Kolbs points are refreshing and affirming At the same time I have to teach students how to read and write with a critical eye so we can have smart citizens who dont believe or reproduce misinformation Its a hard balance because critical often feels like the enemy of creativeImageCreditPhotographs by Josephine SittenfeldThe Picture Prompt Childhood Bedroom asked students what the items in their bedroom say about their future, their goals and dreams, and how they spend their time.Mackenzie Boone from Wilmington, N.C., has a room smothered with books:I have a problem with not throwing things away that stays the same whether its scraps of paper and bits of trash or the random postcards Ive gathered through the years My floor is covered in clothes mostly clean so I can access them fast and easy when getting ready for school This doesnt happen its still somehow my excuse for the mess And everywhere there are books In to be read piles favorite or comfort book piles new and no home piles musician biography piles the classics pile You name it Not to mention the two bookshelves also smothered with books They are the most consistent items in my room because when I moved throughout my childhood it was always something to give my new room the homey feel I wanted in a new place My books are from my youngest years all the way up to the three books I bought last week They are all around the house because I refuse to let any of them go but the special ones live in my room Some have flowers from England or dandelions from Texas some have handmade bookmarks or literal lost puzzle pieces even poems and thoughts from specific moments of my life to future me These books bear the scars of my childhood They are battered worn and loved So I think if I had to pick any item in my room to describe my life and my strengths it would be all of my books collectively They are genuinely a part of my past present and future self and its evident when looking at themHaley Moroz from Wilmington, N.C., says holding on to certain items is a way of holding on to personal strengths:Last month I thought it was a good idea to go through my room My findings were very interesting as I found old clothes Birthday Cards and other hoarding materials The garbage can outside was filled all the way to the top with junk I started to realize that the stuff I didnt throw away was important to me I found a letter I wrote to myself in th grade I also found a Birthday card that my aunt wrote which she lives in Colorado That meant a lot because I dont get to see her a lot Finding these treasures made me remember these exact momentsSimilar to the author I didnt throw these away I kept them in a box which is now in my closet Including my middle school awards first pair of cleats and etc As I head into the future I will cherish these memories By doing this I will fix my mistakes and hold onto my strengths Holding onto these maintains who I amVeronica from Kaplon says certain items are too important to toss:My room is a direct reflection of the chaos happening in my mind around the clock Sometimes Ill uncover something intriguing but typically it just get shoved into the background without much consideration Perhaps an old shirt in the corner representing a more sane time in my life a sequenced dress representing a time I was less careful and more open to the AM social scenes You know the all too common annoying teenage problems which I cant seem to shake quite yet Truth be told looking at the surface of clothes which hang from every orifice in my room I could dispose of of the thingsOh but not my cherry red lipstick and the slightly cracked picture of my family Dont ask about the crack I havent quite figured it out just yetJordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., keeps things that will help her reminisce when she grows up:If somebody wants to get to know me all they need to do is to come inside my room Over the past few months I have gone through all of my belongings and have thrown the junk away while keeping all the things that actually matter Awards from Elementary school for being in the art show toss my old dance shoes into the trash But other objects that matter my old American Girl dolls post cards from a trip to Greece and aged photos are some of the things that I want to carry into the future I have crafted my room to paint a complete picture of who I am That way when I am older and grown up I will have a lot of reminiscing to do when I come back to my childhood bedroomEmilia Cordon from Wilmington, N.C., keeps things that bring her to another time:Recently Ive excavated my room finding much of the norm too many pointe shoes to count some random clothes I would never consider wearing today and just a ton of junk I filled two whole trash bags with junk Not every thing was junk though I found a letter I wrote to myself about hating my mom a birthday card I wrote for someone in third grade but never gave to them and a violin from my classical music era These types of items bring me to another time like the author of the essay I can almost fathom exactly how I felt at that moment just by seeing a remnant from my pastThere are things I would never consider throwing away Things like my first pair of pointe shoes my middle school graduation awards or my art and map that covers the walls These things are part of myself and my past that I would like to remember While I evolve into a better person I still want to hold onto the past and either remember my mistakes or my strengths I dont know if this hints to my destiny but I want to retain my identity as I travel into the futureImageCreditJonathan CalugiOur Student Opinion question Are You Intimidated by Classical Music and Art asks students how they feel about classical music, modern art, theater and opera.Meghan Miraglia from Massachusetts has never been afraid, and has suggestions for the intimidated:I have never been afraid of classical music Perhaps its because Im a flutist but Ive never shied away from Tchaikovsky Ive never been skittish of the Goldberg VariationsIt is a great tragedy when we think of classical music as being haughty or the sort of music that only plays in art galleries When we constrict concertos to being things that exist in certain parts of our lives we miss out on the humanity of music Let classical music bleed into the modern era Let your heartbreaks align with the great crescendos of cellos Let your life fall into a handful of measures and then and perhaps only then will you learn to appreciate music the way it was meant to be appreciatedThe best way to watch a concert where classical music is being played is to simply not watch at all Close your eyes Let your mind wander as the orchestra carries you through major and minor through tempos you can feel throughout your entire body Dont let yourself be intimidatedCollin from Lawrence dislikes the pretention around classical music, and says it is for everyone:It is sad to hear that people are intimidated by classical musicI would like to begin by saying that I have been playing the piano for a while and I can see where people might feel intimidated by a classical piece In most classical pieces there isnt a band or a producer there are or so musicians working together to produce a masterpiece to the ear This is intimidation in its own right most people dont sit down with some friends and throw on The Four Seasons by Vivaldi It is complex and full of life to truly enjoy it you must listen to it live But where there is live music there will be people Here is where I can understand I cant tell you how many people will try to put themselves above everyone else by talking about How splendid the crescendo was or How the staccato really gives the piece a unique sound This stuff even annoys me and I understand what it means To someone just looking to enjoy some nice music this can be a major turn off I think this is the biggest issue for newcomers There seems to be an obligation to say crescendo instead of It Gets Louder This negative stigma makes it seem like you must be well educated to enjoy music this isnt true If you have ears you can appreciate music its that simpleKaplan Aktas from North Carolina thinks familiarity adds to the attraction:Ive loved classical music since I first listened to it and to put it plainly I cant wrap my head around this Classic music insecurity complex because classic music in and of itself is a form of art The symphonies are each like a vivid painting and the composer an artist As for the second question I would totally be willing to listen to a performance or piece due to the dedication of the composer or violinist etc and the beauty that is classic musicThere are times when I cant appreciate music if I know what it was truly about or how it was created or simply because Ive listened to it way to many times But on the contrary the more I know about a certain song on the matter of how it was made or its meaning I can like it much more like Overture With Cannons Yes he actually had cannons at the performance which was made by Tchaikovsky to commemorate Napoleons invasion of Russia or Richard Wagners Ride of The Valkyries which reminds me of the iconic opening scene of ride of the Valkyries and many other parallel scenesElliott ODeen from North Carolina hopes classical-style music will continue to be played and enjoyed:I am a musician and I love and appreciate all music I appreciate modern day music and symphonic pieces from the s I know people seem to have CMI the insecurity of not being able to fully understand the technical aspects of music but still are moved I dont think anyone should feel that way because yes the composer or artist have intentions with the ways they want you to feel but music is for everyone Whether you are a musician or just a casual listener its okay to have opinions about music in which you dont know the full meaningClassical style music will hopefully always be made so there is always time to have a great appreciation for it even if you dont fully get itEleanor Black from Wilmington NC, has just begun to appreciate classical music:I have recently begun to listen to classical music I think it is a very beautiful experience and Im ashamed to say that I didnt realize I had been intimidated by it until I read this article Everything about classical music is bold and sophisticated the volume the tempo even the words they use to describe their pieces such as the work features a truncated development with chromatic modulations to distant keys and modally inflected motivic cells The Classical Music Insecurity Complex is what causes people to feel uncomfortable listening and or talking about this genre You dont have to know a thing about classical music to enjoy listening to it Its all about the way the music makes you feel when you listen to it and I hope that more people will one day be willing to branch out of their comfort zone and try listening to itJohn Smith from Cherry Hill NJ references scientific evidence that music changes the brain, and thinks both music and the brain inspire awe:MUSICOPHILIA MUSIC THE BRAIN Is one of the masterpieces of the late renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks To me it is his crowning glory Sacks wrote that with the brain scans of the s and s scientists were able to observe the activity in centers of the brain far more accurately than before They discovered that music engages more brain activity than any other human area of study In fact he mentioned in an interview with Terry Gross in Fresh Air on NPR that if he had Einsteins brain it would look no different from any other brain But if he took the brain of a professional musician the impact of music on the brain results in highly visible changes in its structure including the thickening of the corpus collossum that connects the two hemispheres of the brain and growth in the area of the brain where sound is processed as well as other areas Music and the brain inspire awe and wonderment Just relax and enjoy it Your brain will take care of the rest Of course if you wish to study you can do that tooJulian Fandino from New York says exposure brings a level of comfort:I have always been exposed to classical music art and theater Ever since I was in my mothers womb classical music has been part of my life My interest and enjoyment of such art forms comes as a result of my exposure to such This has allowed me to be more comfortable and interested in seeking an understanding of these mediums In the end it was my interactions with classical music art and theater that have further enhanced my enjoyment of them I feel my experience is a great example for the claim made by Mr Hoffman theres no denying that the more we know about music as with cooking or gardening or football the more levels of enjoyment are available to usRamatoulaye Diallo from New York said relatives and friends have influence:Growing up I would always listen to rap and rb If someone were to tell me to listen to classical music I would have probably laughed and wonder if they were serious The people I was surrounded by influenced me to listen to music aside from classical music In all I would say that I am intimidated by modern art and classical music but that all is from my roots and how I grew up Reading this article did not change my opinion on classical music because I am so costumed to a specific type a music I do not see myself attending a performance because I am simply not interested in it However I do agree with Hoffman when he said that the educational system have a part in Classical Music InsecurityImageRonnie Abaldonado competing during the Red Bull BC One breakdancing world finalsCreditRomina AmatoRed Bull via Getty ImagesStudents weigh in on our Picture Prompt Breakdancing with their thoughts about whether dance should be an Olympic event.Kayla Renee from Pennsylvania says it should:I say that if cheerleading and gymnastics are considered a sport that breakdancing should be too Breakdancing is more than just dancing it targets your muscles and requires strength just like every other sport Breakdancing has its own world of battling and competitions which is why I think it shouldnt be an olympic sport but if it was thatd be pretty coolBrooke Myers from King of Prussia agrees:Break dancing should definitely be in the Olympics it takes tons of practice like everything else uses a lot of concentration and takes a lot of work It would also add a little more spice to the Olympics Id also like to see rock climbing as an Olympic sport its so different and people dont even think about it but it takes the same amount of work pressure concentration and practice if not morePinappleCake from NC thinks dance is more about artistic expression than competition:Taking an art like dancing to the Olympics is something I would not watch To me dancing is a way to express myself when I am happy or eating really good food Watching people show off their dancing skills might be cool for the next person but for me its something that has a deeper meaning than competitionNick Hargrove from Wilmington NC, believes dance does not fit the criteria for an Olympic event:I personally do not think breakdancing should be an Olympic Sport There has to be a point where you draw the line The article went on to talk about some things such as a rubiks cube competition or hacky sack which just seems plain out absurd to me While these activities may take a extensive amount of time and dedication I do not perceive the people competing in these competitions as athletes Honestly I think for the IOC to open up the Olympics to new competitions it ruins the integrity of the Olympic Games Breakdancing has no place in the Olympics until it is further established Serouj Aprahamian a breakdancer even petitioned that the IOC who was known for ballroom dancing would have no idea how to run a breakdancing competitionAnother thing I feel like that is crucial when determining whether a new sport should be introduced to the Olympic Games is is there room for it While there are currently summer sports there are only winter sports One sport that I enjoy playing and watching is baseball While it is not recognized as an Olympic game I am completely fine with it as there is the World Baseball Classic which is also held every four yearsWhile the article may have jokingly mentioned Donkey Kong as a potential Olympic event I do see gaming being at least questioned as whether it should be a Olympic event or not I play plenty of video games myself but rather than introducing esports into the Olympics they should instead create an EOlympicsImageCreditKeith NegleyHow Alike Are You and Your Friends challenged students to think about these relationships through the lens of scientific research on brain activity:James Wilt from Wilmington NC thinks friends can have dissimilar personalities:When I finished reading both articles I was left surprised and skeptical that there might be a scientific correlation to us being friends Although this might be true friendships develop over time You dont instantly become good friends with someone it takes a while Some of my friends Ive known for years but havent started actually being friends with until this year Friendships are not entirely dependent on sharing extremely similar personalities Im a quiet liberal who isnt the most social person on the planet while a lot of my friends are very talkative conservatives who are incredibly social It doesnt matter Were friends because were different because if we were all similar it would be like talking to yourself all of the time and that would become maddeningAnon from Germantown Md prefers friends with different opinions:I happen to go from friend to friend not having a permanent group However the people I happen to be friends with always have characteristics similar to my own Humor for one is a driving factor in who I look to seek companionship from I believe its important to surround yourself with different opinions so you wont shroud yourself in a bubble and so you can grow as a person I am not very surprised to see a scientific correlation because there must be some reason as to why I am drawn to specific people specifically those of the opposite gender who are around my age and have similar but not exactly the same socioeconomic conditionsJiwon Lee from CA shares common attributes and background with friends:My friends and I are very alike in a way of being indecisive and innocent Also we all are Asians sophomores and short we have almost same heights We are interested in Asian food and culture Since I have friends who are very similar to me in terms of personality interests appearance and educational level I have expected that a persons friends would be similar to the person in personality or backgrounds but I never knew that friends have similar brain activities I thought that way because we became friends after some time we met for the first time I dont think we really had any instant chemistry with my best friends I dont remember why but we started having lunches together at some point Then we somehow continued our awkward conversations and found out what we have in common The advantage of having similar friends is that we could keep talking constantly about many topics because we usually talk about what we are all interested in and knowledgeable about However having similar friends does not help very much about extending my knowledge or views because I wouldnt get to hear different perspectives On the other hand I could learn a lot from friends who are not similar to me but I often feel overwhelmed when they explain so much information to me and I dont understand most of their explanationRachel Long from Wekiva High School remembers bonding right away:I tend to see patterns with my closest friends with the way we behave the way we speak our facial expressions and mannerisms but this is all after we have been very close for a while I have a very large and diverse friend group but one commonality that I know we all share is determination and drive to succeed and similar mentalities when it comes to school and sports alike The fact that my friends and I are so alike in this way causes us to push each other to be our best selves instead of allowing each other to just be good However sometimes this becomes more of a competition than motivation While not all of my friends are my best friend the people that I consider my best friends are the least like me They were easy to connect with and we didnt judge each other upon first meeting We were able to bond right awayKayla Renee from Pennsylvania likes differences:Me and my friends are similar I wouldnt use the word alike Being exactly like your friends is boring because eventually you learn their every move My friends and I dont always see eye to eye on everything but for the most part we have the same tastes in music and enjoy the same activities No two friends should be exactly alike or enjoy EVERYTHING together friends argue and disagree all the time Without our differences wed all be OrdinaryJordyn Ives from Westfield NJ agrees difference makes friendship interesting:I share the same core values with all of my friends What brings us together is our overall trust that we have with each other and an understanding that goes beyond simple things We all value honesty kindness grades and most of all loyalty While at the center we all very much similar there is little overlap in our personalities and interests Everybody in my group has different things that they are involved in That is what makes us interesting If everybody was the same the world would be a very boring place Some of my friends like sports others art and writing But no matter how different we are what really matters is that we all share a mutual understanding and have similar values above all elseImageCreditEvah FanStudents responded to the question Are You Conforming to or Rebelling Against Your Parents Wishes for You with details of their hopes and

my parents because we want the same things I long to be a doctor when I grow up and they support me maybe its because theyre doctors too Being halfasian I know the struggles that the author points out but I do realize that my parents have high expectations not because of my background but because of me It sounds like the author had numerous toxic fights with her parents which is not the case in my family My parents only push me to do what they know I can do although I know this is not the case with other familiesI talk to my parents about my future knowing that they know more than I do I want to go into the same field as them so I ask if they could do it over again what profession would they go into I think I am more like my dad but I can relate to my mom too Seeing the differences between my family and the authors family widens my perspective about American expectations I think that as long as a child knows that their parents want whats best for them its easier for both sides to understand each otherI love and trust my parents and we have a great relationship because of their expectations I am grateful that they are open about my accomplishments and decisions Its important to find a balance between expectations and openmindednessAshton H from NC both conforms and rebels:Parents hopefully want the best for their child However what the parent wants may not be what child wants or even what the child needs Personally I fall in between rebelling and conforming I try not to do anything that would horribly upset them but I also wont back down There are some things about me that are just part of who I am whether or not parents want to accept it Most of my choices do upset them and definitely confuse them and most of that has to do with the fact that what is more widely accepted today by the world was not what was widely accepted for the majority of their lives These decisions do affect my relationship quite a bit and have since caused a lot of stress and strife But in the end it is my life Im not interested in breaking laws or hurting anyone I just want to be myselfThe parents of Jordyn Ives from Westfield NJ, have one rule:My parents want me to do something with my life that is my choice but there is one contender I must be able to support myself After college I must be able to live on my own and maintain a job I have to major in something that has great job prospects so I can go out into the real world I am confident that whatever career I choose my parents will support me Their ultimate wish is that I pursue a career in something that I am passionate about I am going to follow my parents guidance when it comes time to pick a major because the last thing I want is to be out of college and my parents are saying I told you soVeronica from

came to my future Dentist one day president of the United States the next I hate to call it a phase because it only accredits my parents more but sure Ill give it to them this time Despite my diabolical and somewhat ourageous aspirations considering their insurmountable odds my parents went along with it Perhaps even encouraged it However upon my graceful induction into what I then called twelveteen their unhinged enthusiasm saw an unexpected pullback And man did I notice Nowadays just a year away from college from the sidelines they lovingly attempt to micromanage all aspects of my life and steer me away from the inevitable horrors which await me How do we engage in these deep analytical thoughtprovoking conservations about my future For now there is nothing a good movie cant fixSome students also make suggestions for how to have difficult conversations with parents. Rosie from Oxford Miss, thinks young people should stand up for what they want:Some of my decisions are way off of my parents wishes and decisions Both of my parents are lawyers and both of my grandfathers are lawyers My dad I believe would like my siblings or I to take over one of the families businesses I would like to be an ophthalmologist which is my dream job My parents agree with me on that but they sometimes disagree with me on the little things All in all my parents love me very much They respect me and my decisions too even if my decisions are not what they want for me Others should confront their parents and say they are set on this particular thing If not you could be forced and pushed into a direction that you wouldnt want to be or do with your lifeMeghan Miraglia from

realized Id make next to nothing Now Im seventeen and I want to be an OT and live in New York City Thatll probably change as plans always do But for now Im happyMy mom was the one who pointed out the holes in my plans Pointed out salaries and the things an average eleven or thirteenyearold will forget Pointed out the sharp edge of reality when my head was in the clouds My mom taught me compassion

Public Square in their communities in response to our Picture Prompt.Jordyn Ives from Westfield NJ., gathers with friends and neighbors downtown:In my neighborhood the downtown area acts as a gathering place for the community After school students from both middle schools flock to the center of town Lines are formed outside of the local drug store where penny candy is sold starbucks the arcade and pizza restaurants where slices can be bought for under bucks The restaurants that line our streets are great for families too along with the large park situated in the middle of town It is the downtown area that really makes our community what it is I am so grateful for it and although I may take this luxury for granted I truly am amazed at how wonderful it feels like to live in a neighborhood with an excellent downtown areaXander Kruvczuk from the United States of America thinks social media has made public gathering places less common:It my hometown the place where all my friends still meet up at is the movie theater Whenever a movie that we all want to see is playing we schedule a time and go to see it Other than that though we never really hang out outside of school I feel like online communication has diminished the amount of places such as these I can easily see how waffle house would be a good meeting place for people to gather The only bad part about waffle house is that there are none in the Northeast Its such a great place to be with family and friendsImageCreditJackie FerrentinoOur Student Opinion prompt Do You Gamify Your Life asks students if they track any numbers related aspect of their lives, like hours slept or steps taken each day.Zech Edwards from Nevada Texas says competition is the reason why some people gamify:As of now I do not relate to anything that Mr Yagoda does but do relate to the ideas he addresses I think the reason people may have these tendencies because in todays age everyone is competitive and being competitive myself in life realize it make sense to relate it to a video game My small triumphs consist of getting better grades than a friend on a test or beating someone in a race or lifting more than someone I am not surprised at the extent to which Mr Yagoda gamifys his everyday life because while I do not relate it to games I do compete with those around me and set goals in the same wayLiliana R from Texas thinks it is fun:I do identify with the habits and behaviors that Yagoda describes Its possible people do this to have fun with life and look at it like a level in a game Sometimes when Im in the car Ill imagine something that happens around me in the buildings or fields I seeChandler Ross from Texas sees the practical applications:I see where Mr Yogoda is coming from in his article Many people plan to or even carry through with mapping out their days or even weeks so that they stay on track example is some families make a Week Meal Menu so they know what each day of the week they are eating and so they can but just things on their list from the grocery store to make those meals and not buy extra items they dont needJazmine from Texas tracks school grades:I personally do not identify myself with the habits and behaviors she describes By Gamify she means by tracking numbers of any sort such as your weight gain your electric bill and your grades for school The only thing I really tend to Gamify is my school grades Because if I Gamify everything else it would become a hassle of time and would become an energy drainerJordyn Ives from Westfield NJ thinks numbers enhance reality:By gamifying life once remedial tasks like going to CVS or taking a shower become adventures Numbers are a way to enhance reality adding excitement to places that need them most I can identify with Mr Yagodas plight because I do the same on an almost daily basis When I am in school I often create a hand writing competition between my right and left hands Considering that I am a righty that hand always wins but nevertheless I still like to keep score In my head I play geography trivia with myself thinking of a random country than trying to say the capital Believe me it makes those boring moments go by in a heartbeat If it was for the games that I play with myself life would be a lot less fun They are not just a way to pass time but to enrich itMackenzie Boone from Wilmington NC says games fight boredom:Ever since I was little I have hated being bored in the car Considering my family takes many a road trip I started pretending my hand was on an obstacle course I would jump and run on telephone lines and have to blink in between every white line on the road It would keep me occupied for a while but eventually Id get bored and want to stop but I never could Id get this strong and really strange feeling that if I didnt finish the game my character would die Which manifested itself into a weird game I couldnt win Obviously this isnt the same as making weight loss a game or turning a CVS into a battleground but Im saying I understand the fascination and innate desire for seemingly pointless or boring journeys to have a purpose Winning and losing are feelings that create drive to achieve or avoid and I dont think its strange to live by that even in the most simple tasksImageCreditMarion FayolleStudents commented on our Picture Prompt Procrastinating with their positive and negative work habits.Mackenzie Boone from Wilmington NC., is a major procrastinator:I think every procrastinator believes they are the worst procrastinator which is exactly how I feel My procrastination habits were once a thing that left me to complete my work in a spur of creativity whenever the moment felt rightBut its gotten to the point where I sit and I wait for some creative idea to hit it never comes and me being so determined to do my best I just dont do it Or when it comes to studying which requires no creativity I feel the need to wait for panic to set in to motivate meBut usually my panic becomes so overwhelming I ignore it like I ignore the looming world war There have been multiple projects though that I have done the night before involving some artistic theme that were not to brag but Im going to brag some of the best in the class Which doesnt help me in truth because then I fool myself into believing procrastination will always benefit me Which I know isnt true but I still somehow stand by that fact So maybe my procrastination habits will destroy my academic life and my future to come but Ill cross that bridge when I come to itBut BetzabethD from YC CLIP likes to get things done as soon as possible:Most of the time I would said I feel myself as a precrastinator I hate when I have to finish any task and I cannot do it for sort of reason in my personal opinion procrastinate a task is a waste of the time If I finish something I believe I can enjoy the free time that I have without any worries or also i can start a new task without have to think in the other one However after read this article its make me think in a different way I never though procrastination could be very helpful when you are planning about to be creativeGiancarloD from YC CLIP falls in between:I am something in between Sometimes when I have time I decide to do the work early but when my friends call me I decide to procrastinate a little bit just to have fun Procrastinating makes us reduce stress However procrastination is in theory bad because we leave our work to the end Most of the time we do not end doing our duty I feel so bad with my habits because I do not have too enough time to do my personal things for example going out with friends enjoying with my family or exercising I only think about work and study I think that I have to change my habits and create a little space for myself Postpone a project to the last minute does not make a better job because you have less time to research and to correct errors In my experience it is better to do our duty in the beginning than procrastinate If you do not do well and have many errors one project that is evaluated in thousands dollars may be devalued to only hundreds of dollarsSome students are frustrated by their procrastination habits, like Rex Hardy from Wilmington NC.:I have always been a procrastinator and it seems a problem Im never going to solveIt all started back in the th grade with Mrs McCullough I had been assigned my first big project the notorious Science Fair Project Not really knowing how much time it would take I waited and waited until the night before it was due I stayed up til or in the morning which was far past my bedtimeLittle did I know that this would be the routine for every project and test for the rest of my school career Ive tried many times to break this habit yet I cant The best Ive done is a temporary fix that lasted for about a couple of weeks New Years Resolutions words for the year and far in advance planning hasnt done the trick Now procrastination doesnt mean all Ive gotten is bad grades In fact that science fair project was picked rd in my school and was chosen to compete at the county level In reality I got away with procrastination all through elementary and middle school This is the first year procrastination has really kicked me in the butt Like my mom has told me on numerous occasions The work is only going to get harder and harder and this habit isnt going to work I shouldve listened a long time ago and I probably wouldnt be sitting with a B average in AP World or staying up tonight to finish multiple assignments I know something has got to change or my dreams of making it to a bigtime college will be goneEventually Ill figure it out rightBut others see the benefits of putting things off until the last minute. Jonathon Calkins from St Cloud Fla says it can help with memory:I am also a procrastinator Procrastinating is often seen as a negative thing I on the other hand see it very differently I believe that I perform my best when I work under the pressure of a time constraint From studying last minute things tend to stay fresh in my brain allowing me to remember things better When I study or do my homework without procrastinating I often find myself daydreaming or getting distracted to easily Procrastinating has gotten me this far in school so I might as well keep it goingAndrea Hernandez from Saint Cloud Fla, feels more focused under pressure:It could be two in the morning and Ill still find an excuse to not complete an essay due the next day In fact Ill just put it aside and set an alarm for am The sound goes off blaring in my ears and the feeling of regret immediately settles in I contemplate my life and all the horrible decisions Ive made leading up to this misery yet I always seem to be the most focused under pressure Knowing the job needs to get done under a time constraint allows me to give my undivided attention to the task at hand disregarding all distractions surrounding me As much as I hate having to procrastinate it has served me well all alongAnd HuberneyD from YC CLIP is more likely to experiment:I am certainly sure that I am a procrastinator I often feel frustrated when getting close to a deadline because I had wasted time in meaningless actions just for entertainment or leisure without completing or even staring an important work or task I do not think procrastinating has a bright side Procrastination makes you waste valued time you could use performing an important task Although I had been in situations where my limited time caused by procrastinating force me to take risks I would not take otherwise As when I was taking painting classes and very often my procrastination habits brought me to the deadline with an empty canvas In those moments in order to finish my painting in one night I experimented with different techniques that sometimes helped me not only finish faster my painting but also leaving good resultsAdvertisement'\n"
