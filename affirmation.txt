b'AdvertisementOpinionSupported byTrump Has Got Democrats Right Where He Wants ThemBy Thomas B EdsallFeb ImageRep Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico second from left surrounded by Dreamers at a news conference before President Trumps first State of the Union addressCreditDoug MillsThe New York TimesPresident Trumps immigration proposal has put Democrats in a bind they know it and he knows itTrumps immigration framework  first outlined on Jan. 25  represents an unusually sophisticated strategy. He proposes to more than double the number of Dreamers granted a path to citizenship, a significant concession to Democrats.In return, he seeks approval of a set of policies strongly opposed by the left, each of which is designed to stem what Trump sees as a threatening increase in the nonwhite population of the United States.What kind of numbers are we talking about? According to the Pew Research Center:In immigrant women accounted for about US births which marked a threefold increase from when immigrant women accounted for about births Meanwhile the annual number of births to USborn women dropped by percent during that same time period from million in to million in There are now an estimated registered Dreamers in the United States, all of whom were brought to this country as children before 2007. Trumps offer would increase the number offered a path to citizenship to 1.8 million by adding those who are eligible for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), but who never registered.For a Democratic Party whose electoral strength depends on Hispanic support ( percent of Latinos identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party in 2016) preventing the deportation of the Dreamers and providing them with legal status has become a matter of political necessity.Trump, acutely aware of the importance of DACA to Democrats, deliberately turned the status of Dreamers into a crisis on Sept. 5 when he ended the Dreamers program.Since then, DACA has been the subject of constant debate and negotiation. Democrats have continued to threaten to shut down the government, when the Treasury runs out of money on Feb. 8, if no favorable agreement can be reached.Trumps proposal more than meets Democratic demands on DACA But in return Trump wants Democrats to swallow three proposals of varying unpalatabilityFirst the creation of a billion fund for construction of a southern border wall to prevent illegal entry to the United States primarily by undocumented HispanicsSecond, a shift in immigration priorities from family reunification to a merit system granting entry to workers with relatively high skills. This would require limiting reunification preferences to minor children and spouses, while eliminating them for parents, siblings and adult children, what critics call chain migration. These steps would reduce immigration from developing countries: The two top countries of origin benefiting from family reunification policies are Mexico and the Dominican Republic.Third, an end to the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program. The countries providing the largest numbers of immigrants under the lottery visa program, according to the State Department, are Cameroon, Congo, Liberia, Egypt, Iran, Nepal, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.The greatest unknown is how immigration reform will influence the voting behavior of the white working classIn a Jan. 29 Vox essay, The math is clear Democrats need to win more workingclass white votes, Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, writes that Democrats seeking to regain control of Congress may be forced to mute their opposition to Trump immigration provisions they find offensive.Teixeira argues thatThe view that Democrats can get along without workingclass white voters is simply wrong It reflects wishful thinking and a rigid set of political priors namely that Democrats political problems always stem from insufficient motivation of base voters more than a cold hard look at what the electoral and demographic data sayThe problem for Democrats is that not only do they need to improve margins among white working-class voters but they cannot allow a repetition of the minority voting patterns in 2016. That year, black turnout fell to 59.6 percent from 66.6 percent in 2012; and Clinton won 66 percent of the Latino vote, five percentage points less than President Barack Obama in 2012.Doug Joness December victory in the Alabama Senate race demonstrated how crucial black voters are to Democrats: In that close contest, African-Americans, percent of whom voted for Jones, made up 29 percent of the electorate. They are 26 percent of the voting age population.The conflicts the Trump proposals present for Democrats are most painful to Hispanic and black elected officialsIn a statement, Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Democrat of New Mexico and chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, attacked Trumps demands:The White House is using Dreamers to mask their underlying xenophobic isolationist and unAmerican policies which will harm millions of immigrants living in the United States and millions of others who want to legally immigrate and contribute to our countryDespite these complaints there are many political analysts sympathetic to the Democratic plight who contend that Trump has boxed Democrats inSteven Gold, a sociologist at Michigan State University, emailed me:Many Democrats fear that extensive investments and political posturing made on behalf of immigrants will be regarded as of little value to a large swath of independent voters whose support Democrats need to increase their representation in CongressIn a reference to the demonstrated electoral liabilities of socalled identity politics Gold argued that concerned Democrats worry thatby emphasizing particularistic rather than practical issues with a broad impact they will once again lose the politically advantageous position that appears to be taking shape for them in and More bluntly, Nolan McCarty, a political scientist at Princeton, declared in an email responding to my inquiry:The Democrats dont have a lot of good options other than to support it enough that it can pass with unified Republican supportMcCarty explained furtherBlocking it would allow the Trump Administration to suggest that the Democrats were willing to trade Dreamers for lottery and chain migration as well as position them as soft on border securityAn advantage in accepting the Trump proposal McCarty continuedis that border security appropriations and visa programs can be fixed if the Democrats regain control The effects of Dreamer deportations andor sending them back into the shadows is far less reversibleTrump and Stephen Miller a senior adviser to the president have clearly made this calculation and decided that they win either way Take for example the following tweet from the presidents account on Jan I have offered DACA a wonderful deal including a doubling in the number of recipients a twelve year pathway to citizenship for two reasons Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA only use itRobert L Borosage, president of the left-liberal Institute for Americas Future, argued that Democrats should make every effort to get the immigration issue off center stage. In my view, Borosage said in an email, Trump wins as long as were arguing about this. So it would be good to get this done soon.Borosage went onWhat should Democrats do Id take the deal after pushing for concessions on family unification and lottery system and pushing against full commitment of billion as an outrageBruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, makes the case that political logic favors Democratic cooperation with Trump on immigration:If the Democrats compromise on a few of the nonDACA items and the Congressional Republican position is no DACA relief then the Republican position becomes untenable and looks as though are caving to their extreme nativist faction And if the Democrats make their position a clean bill on DACA and no compromise on the other items it hands the Republicans a perfect wedge item going into the election possibly keeping them in control of both housesIn fact I found an unexpectedly high percentage of the experts I contacted most of whom are sympathetic to the plight of immigrants in general agreement that Democrats would be wise to come to some kind of an agreement with TrumpDaniel Hopkins, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, noted, for example, that the public supports both a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and enhanced border security. But, he warned,in todays political climate its very hard to imagine a deal that will placate both sides for long as both parties seem to define winning in zerosum termsSo far at least arguments in favor of cutting a deal are not selling with the Democratic leadership although the leaders position may be more of a bargaining tactic than a principled stanceChuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, tweeted on Jan that this plan flies in the face of what most Americans believe, addingWhile realDonaldTrump finally acknowledged that the Dreamers should be allowed to stay here and become citizens he uses them as a tool to tear apart our legal immigration system and adopt the wish list that antiimmigration hardliners have advocated for yearsNancy Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, was more outspoken. In a Jan statement that received wide press coverage, she described Trumps proposal as part of the Trump Administrations unmistakable campaign to make America white again.After Trump reiterated his immigration proposals in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Pelosi stood firm in her opposition:The president represents himself as generous towards Dreamers but he is holding them hostage with the most extreme antiimmigrant agenda in generations We heard more insulting words of ignorance and prejudice towards patriotic immigrant families last nightIn a detailed critique of the Trump proposal, William Frey, a demographic specialist at Brookings, argued thatthe socalled compromise between DACA and border security is extremely disproportional weighted heavily toward the latter which is characterized by simple bumper sticker messages about family migration border security and the visa lottery that is aimed at appealing to the extreme antiimmigrant wings of Trumps Republican baseFrey wrote in his email that he couldnot imagine Democratic senators or congressmen agreeing to anything close to this plan in light of their base which not only includes Hispanics AsianAmericans and other minorities but also rising support in recent state and local elections they have received from suburban college graduate women and millennialsNonetheless, in a Washington Post oped published in 2015, Frey pointed out thatDemocrats cannot make the politics of fear go away simply by courting the youngadult and minority voting blocs While it is true that the supersize turnout and support of those groups helped elect President Obama twice the white portion of the electorate which votes strongly Republican underperformed in support of John McCain in and white turnout was down in There is Frey continued a sharp lag in diversity between the overall population and the portion that turns out on Election Day It is the older electorate those most greatly fearing change he wrotethat will be gaining as baby boomers continue to age By my calculation the number of mostly white eligible voters over age will be percent larger in than those under age This disparity will be further widened by the higher turnout of older white voters who may not determine future elections but will continue to have a strong voiceWhen I asked him if there was a disparity between his recent comment to me and the Post oped Frey wrote backI stand by the fact that the politics of fear to older noncollege whites can work to some extent But I also think white women especially college graduate white women can help to mute the impact on the immigration issue because of their disdain for Trump If Dems are looking at its not just the immigration issue that is important to those women but Trumps stance on womens issues in general critical of planned parenthood abortion his support of Roy Moore in Alabama his disdain for political correctness and his overall boorishness may counter whatever gains he may get on immigration from older white noncollege men and women and even the latter support may be more tenuous Another group is millennials now strongly antiTrump who could be motivated to turn out in greater numbersIn short the base that will respond to Trump playing the immigration card may be dwindling in light of his other positions and demeanor since in office including his handling of the Russian investigation I think the Democrats are counting on thatIt may seem surprising now, but the Pew Research Center found that from 1994 to 2006 there was very little difference between the views of Republican and Democratic voters on immigration. Since that time they have diverged sharply.In response to the question Which comes closer to your view immigrants today strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents or immigrants today burden the country by taking jobs housing and health care there was almost no difference in the responses of Democrats and Republicans in In percent of Democrats had a positive view of immigration compared with percent of RepublicansIn a circumspect analysis of the immigration issue, Morris Levy, a political scientist at the University of Southern California, argued in an email that public views of immigration are complex and sometimes contradictory:It is tempting to read polls as a reflection of what the public wants on some issue Politicians and activists routinely portray poll results in this way when they seem to lend popular legitimacy to their preferred programs The reality is more complicated The great majority of Americans do not hold clear stable welldefined positions on almost any of these issuesLevy wrote that his sense is that a final dealcould include funding for the wall which was in fact not an unpopular policy idea until it became a signature issue in Trumps campaign and possibly also curtailing the diversity visa lotteryHe cautioned however that it isunlikely that the Democrats would accede to anything approaching the kinds of sweeping cuts to familybased admissions that the administration has proposedEven if much of the public has ambivalent feelings about immigration that doesnt mean the issue will have no more than a moderate impact on the electionAnimosity to immigration was crucial to Trumps Electoral College victory, especially in rural Rust Belt counties.But the legislative framework Trump proposed is by no means risk-free for Republicans. Emily Ekins, director of polling at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote me that:This framework may anger a critical component of Trumps base if they come to view it as amnesty This in turn could impact turnout in the midtermsCrucially Ekins noted that immigration attitudes wereone of the strongest predictors of Obama-Trump voters. Thus, if these voters come to believe that Trump has betrayed them on one of their primary reasons of support, they may be less mobilized come the 2018 midterms and perhaps in 2020. While Trumps supporters have stuck with him throughout numerous controversies, perceived betrayal on immigration might be the one issue that could cost Trump his base.From another vantage point, Democratic House incumbents face an exceptionally large number of primary challengers this year, many of them from the left, supported by such groups as Justice Democrats, Indivisible and other insurgent organizations.For these challengers, a failure to protect the Dreamers would be a powerful issue in a primary contest, a potential threat increasing pressure on current Democratic members of Congress to reach an agreement. Further complicating the matter, however, is that Democratic primary challengers are equally likely to accuse incumbents of selling out if they vote to support funding for the border wall.For Republicans it would be difficult to defend televised deportations of hardworking lawabiding young men and women to countries of which they have little or no memoryDavid Leege, an emeritus political scientist at Notre Dame, has trenchantly observed thatThere is more political capital in an issue left festering than in a problem solvedAs both parties struggle with the logistical and moral quagmire that the immigration issue represents they face problems that they need to solve and not to solve at the same time I invite you to follow me on Twitter Edsall.
