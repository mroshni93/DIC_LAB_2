Jersey established a sweeping new law that all but eliminated cash bail, the state has found itself facing a challenge familiar to others that have overhauled their bail systems: an energetic legal attack from the bail industry.In June and July two lawsuits were filed in Federal District Court in New Jersey challenging the statute the Criminal Justice Reform Act which took effect on Jan While the suits have taken different legal tacks they do have something in common one was filed by a large corporate bail underwriter and the other has received support and publicity from professional bail agents Both parts of the bail industry have said that their profits have plummeted since the law took effectNew Jersey is among a handful of states where courts and government officials have begun in recent years to modernize and in some cases abolish the assignment of cash bail which critics say discriminates against defendants many of them black and Latino who cannot afford to pay The New Jersey law which was designed to keep the poor from languishing in jail especially for minor offenses has put the state at the forefront of a growing national movement toward major change and was notable for having the support of its Republican governor Chris ChristieBut the movement has occasioned resistance from the bail industry which has launched an assertive effort to preserve the practice and its own commercial interests The Bail Bond Association of New Mexico for instance filed suit against the state on July challenging a set of State Supreme Court rules governing bail that were passed just weeks beforeIn January Paul D Clement a lawyer who once served as United States solicitor general testified on the industrys behalf at a hearing in Maryland against that states new rules Lawyers for the industry have also submitted amicus briefs in recent months in cases in Atlanta Houston New Orleans and San Francisco trying to stop civil rights groups from suing in the federal courts to overhaul bail in those citiesConcern about the changes has reached such a pitch among the countrys bail bondsmen that the president of the Professional Bail Agents of the United States an industry trade group issued what she called A Declaration of War in the groups August newsletterWe have the responsibility to stand against the forces of tumult and division wrote the president Beth Chapman who is married to the former star of the TV show Dog the Bounty Hunter Duane Chapman We must stand united and strong willing to fight back and wage war against the special interests who would destroy law and order in this country to advance their radical agendaIn the middle of the fight the two suits in New Jersey have attracted attention not only because they are especially aggressive but also because they may become a bellwether for other states that are trying to fend off attacks on bail reformI think the reason youre seeing such intensity by the bail industry to undermine reform in New Jersey is that it will have an effect on the national landscape said Alexander Shalom a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who is helping state officials defend themselves in one of the cases The industry is upset about losing business in New Jersey But the bigger problem is If theres successful reform in New Jersey it can be replicated elsewhereThe first New Jersey suit was submitted by Mr Clement in June on behalf of the Lexington National Insurance Corporation a bail underwriter in Maryland which like others in the field assumes the ultimate financial risk from local bail bondsmen if defendants do not appear in court Filed as a class action its named local plaintiff is Brittan B Holland a New Jersey man who was charged in April with assault after being accused of beating up two patrons of a tavern in Winslow Township during a fight over a football gameAccording to the suit Mr Holland wanted and had the means to post cash bail with the help of a bondsman but under the new state law he was released from jail after being fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet or what the suit referred to as a modernday scarlet letter This led to severe deprivations of liberty the suit claimed including home detention the fact that the government could track Mr Holland hours a day and a requirement that he report to court officials every two weeks Oral arguments in the case will be heard in Federal District Court in Camden on TuesdayThe second suit was filed on July 31 by June Rodgers, whose son Christian Rodgers died in April after being shot 22 times in Vineland by a felon who had been released on bail for a weapons violation. In the suit, Ms. Rodgers claimed that the states new bail law created a system where African-Americans in New Jersey, like her son, received disparate treatment. The suit also blamed Governor Christie and the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, a social-justice organization that created a tool for assigning bail that was incorporated into the law, for violating her 14th Amendment due process rights, including the right to companionship with her son.The day the suit was filed, the Chapmans appeared at a news conference in Trenton announcing the litigation. Mr. Chapman stood in front of the cameras attacking New Jerseys dangerous, fake reform of bail, which, he said, had been in effect for 200 years. Ms. Chapman added that people are not in jail because theyre poor  theyre in jail because they broke the law. In pursuing her case against the state, Ms. Rodgers is being represented by Nexus Caridades, a pro bono law firm that is funded by a company called Nexus that offers services to immigrants who need bail.Jeff Clayton the executive director of the American Bail Coalition a national organization of bail underwriters questioned the premise of the changes by saying that the various laws and rules across the country were damaging public safety a notion that officials in New Jersey and elsewhere have disputed Mr Clayton also said that there were constitutional problems with the overhaul efforts not only under the th Amendment but also under the Fourth Amendment which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and the Eighth Amendment which guards against excessive bailBut Alec Karakatsanis, a lawyer for Civil Rights Corps, a nonprofit organization that has been involved in several of the bail cases, called the cash-bail system a catastrophe, adding, Its enormously unjust and enormously costly.And now thats it being scrutinized by people and the government Mr Karakatsanis said I dont think the industrys efforts to fight this movement will succeedCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated the New Jersey lawsuit for which oral arguments were beginning on Tuesday in Federal District Court Those arguments are for a suit brought on behalf of Brittan B Holland who was charged with assault in a bar fight in Winslow TownshipCorrection: An earlier version of this article mischaracterized a socialjustice groups role in the creation of the law overhauling New Jerseys bail system The Laura and John Arnold Foundation created a tool for assigning bail that was adopted by state lawmakers in writing the law The foundation did not help draft the legislationA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: In National Battle Over Bail Bond Industry, New Jersey Is on the Front Line.
